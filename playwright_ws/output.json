PROP. & EDITOR ANTI-JAPANESE AGITATION In a scries of articles (none ol which shall ho reproduced without the author’s permission) I shall review and discuss the nnti-.lupanesf agitation in California, more particu larly the work of the Antl-.\\;duth League, a sore spot, in American Japanese relations. Honorable Mel lowan *s speech i* 100 long here to he reproduced. s< I shall give the gist of bis “argn menls” in his own words absolutely nneohnvd. He says: (1) “This degrading and vicious Japanese immigration, now com mending to pollute onr fair Stall by it.s undesirable presence.” (2 “As sentinels we look across tin Pacific to the Far East to ohservi countries teeming with ignorant and degraded labor: where harsl environment has made labor slaves: where moral conditions, the result of a cheap labor system, are dis gnsting and revolting; where labor is ground down in the dirt of deg radafion: where it is restive, vi cions and criminal.” HD “Tin labor of that part of the world i* not only cheap and nasty, but ifully satisfied when its physical wants are satisfied.” i I ■ If Asia lie immigration continues with itcheap, nasty labor and its had morals, it moans the undermining 'of onr industrial system and the pan perizaf ion of onr labor, that is now I be most potent and beneficent faetor in onr wood rubs civilization.' (•»/ We ol tin* (’oast are alarmed at Hie rapidly increasing Japanesi immigration now invading every avenue of trade and labor.” ((») “They are absolutely devoid of commercial honor; that falsehood is a virtue, that the truth is never used when a falsehood can he pre sen ted to their profit.” 7) “Sexnul morality in Japan is at the lowest ebb.” Prostitution exists to an alarming extent and is regarded with a high degree of favor as a legitimate occupation.** TS) “Out observation teaches ns that quite ; percentage ol the Japanese popn lotion is before criminal courts charged with violation of onr law The Japanese as a rule are combative. disposed to violate* onr law. untruthful, and vicious to a de gree.” ( !l) To compete with Jap atiese “means a surrender of man hood, a dest met ion of home, a debasement of labor, and slavery more onerous and degrading than ever endured by any child of sunny Africa.” (llh “\\Ve have now in like some of the American mer chants, are dishonest. But within j the past fifty years the foreign trade of Japan has grown hy leaps j and bounds and is making every i nation envious of her. (See Finan eial Annuals of Japan.) Was the growth accomplished been use the, Japanese are dishonest or been use they hold that “ Honesty is the best poficy”? Use common sense in your judgment. I low about sexual morality in America ? Are not wives made and unmade with an equal fneililv Who is ignorant of Renot The less Americans talk about it. tin belter for them. Americans an not particularly qualified to judge, still less criticize, the sexual morality of other people. The sitna lion in America demands all Itcii attention. It is not denied that prostitution does exist in Japan, as it does everywhere. America not excepted. Does it exist to “an alarming degree’’ alone in Japan ? I low about these facts ! “In New York there are -pi.non persons engaged in the slave .traffic within the knowledge of the police, In Chicago the vice commission counted 50,000 such women, while in San Francisco 2.000 unfortunate women have been consigned to the night, life of the streets, slave dens and houses of shame.” “The ‘business’ amounted to over $15,000,000 in Chicago last year, nearly as much as the sale of cattle. Thousands of men are today engaged in the work of solely procuring girls, and 50,00(1 such creatures live in the Cniled States off the earnings of fallen women.” Tims spoke Hahhi Marlin A. Meyer before the .students of the I Adversity of California. October 111. 1012. Met lowan's “observation** concerning the criminal inclination of the Japanese is not borne out in facts. Head the police records of various cities and towns of the State. “The Japanese are the least criminally inclined of immigranf races in America.” The ninth and tenth charges are the logical conclusion of the first four charges, staled in eloquence worthy of a cheap dramatist. Beyond this what can we say ? Head the Heporls of the C. S. Immigration Commission. Olmstead's \"Back Country” will give a vivid picture of the African enslaved hy the members of this “ wondrous civ ilization. ” As to the eleventh charge. .Me Cow an himself admits that his I “physically diseased and morally rotten Japanese’’ still have enough energy and brains not only to aeqnire education but also with it to “deprive yon (Americans) of (be means of making a living.” That means that Americans iimsl be mis erably a helpless lot or else that even (he degraded Japanese an ''lill •••juiil to them or **v# • 11 superior { lo '•\"•in. < Mlimvisi'. the Japanese c*otil«l not In- “rotten “ nfl«T all Tins is Ilia I-. iciil Conclusion of his j s l eh.

WADA. j News And Comments IN REPLY TO “A FRIEND.” First of all we wish to ex pres? ’■ jour gratitude for the kindly inter •'jest yon take in our people. Wi s wish to add also that criticism fa J 1 vorahle or adverse is always W(*l I ‘I j come, so long as such criticism b -fair and just. • If the English section of our pa II per can serve as “such a good nve ' uue for educating the American* * and Europeans here to the rca I worth of the Japanese, their idea* ii Mini ideals.’’ as you say. we ai 1 n certainly more than gratified. You are doiii»lless aware of the fact that e so much injustice has heen ami still l: is being done to our people by tin v Americans and Europeans, whin j i races, for no other reason than that we are Japanese, or “Japs*’ oi -1 ‘‘little brown men.’* as we an i* I more frequently called in America and Europe. ITider the eircum , li stances, if some of our contributor' j, show any sign of bitterness, that i- , i entirely due to the above filet. I»ul j i so far, none of them have violated the IK pled decorum of polite so i eiely. Your object ion to the us.- of tin term, “white.\" designating tin i American and Europeans. is n«»i witauthority. nml. therefore, is legit i nisi t«* in away. lin I in scientific discussions the terms Americans or Europeans an- 100 indefinite. for the i'i-iikiiii that Im*t.h of those raees are ('aneasian. or white. Iml only in part. For instance, take* tin* ethnic composition of the* American population. Of the entire number of hi. 700.000. over 10.000.000 are made up of the* Negro. Indian. Japanese. Chinese md other colored races and these cannot he considered as a negligible entity. Of the European races fome are not while. Tin* Iherains. for instance. How would you class them.’ They are just as dark as we are. if not darker. A sharp distinction of color line there is indeed no easv la.sk. We realize this dif lienlly. Such being the ease, the term, ‘‘white,” is used for the sake of convenience by sociologist#, histo rians, biologists and even by polili eians. Our contributors doubtless employ the term, ‘‘‘white.” as it is used I»\\ the scientist and not in the sense the politician uses it. This is •dearly shown by the context of tin articles that appeared in our paper We believe, therefore, that yon and vonr friends* interpretation of our use of the term is not quite fair. With ns “white” does not earn the meaning of contempt or disrv spect. Certainly we do not ns.* it as does the negro. vi/... “white trash.” I lowever. if such a good friend like yon. and your friends, will to Jsl that “.Japanese can't expect u to res them if they have nom for themselves, they feel their in .’eriorily or they wouldn't call us white.* and we would avoid the term.” We would not embarrass you. Thus meede gracefully 'because we need your assistance in our campaign of education. A better understanding of Japanese by Americans and Americans by Japanese is needed now more than ever. We all need to be cultured, for we are supposed to he civilized A HYBRID. TOKYO INDUSTRIAL EXHIBIT. The plan to hold a Tokyo Industrial Exhibition in the 47th year of Meiji, was abandoned at the death of the late Emperor. Hut the matter has since been revived and there is now talk among the city anthorities of holding an exhibition in the third year of Taisho (11)1 4i, when the coronation of the Emperor i Voshihito will take place. The matter is now said to be formimr the subject of negotiation between Covernor Abe of Tokyo-fu and the chief business men of the capital. NO. 4f54. MORE FRUIT IN JAPAN.

The first experiment in distant wireless telephone, made recently had very satisfactory results, and the Department of Communications is encouraged to carry on tin* experiment. Chief Engineer Torigata. of the Department of Communications, put up two posts, each over 80 ft. high, near the Ben ten bash i bridge, Yokohama. last August, to carry on experiments in wireless telephone. The distance between the bridge and the Communications Office is about In miles, and the voice was heard louder and more distinctly than on the ordinary telephone. Mr. Torigata will increase the distance in the next experiment and will try to communicate with a launch which will be sent out with two 20 ft. high poles aboard. 0 即 3116 站れけ 600(18 霣小卸货雅術美农日行商泶紀む仁 ！115！\\ 又 ，1)6313113 ！11 £11111 け ¢4 \\\\ .1181 21111！\\ 111101108, 36.11111[111 A^( た 11 ロ 1！11 げ 0 71011 し ’111*103， 157-159 6 【 八阶 $1 肝 [ 了 I？ ド 3 れ亡 ]! 5101*6 152 阽汕 N¥ 玎 .， 只 〇 161 211116111^ 01300, 痲病噸治囁新保證樂 1 屋弗吵艮到内用奶 ー 瓶一热洗滌器一個廿五仙するを得れば ^^ 内外両 1 を併用せば必す病甜を撲滅す軤從は一雇如何なろ讯從も一日 |： して撕さ去りニニ肽にて全治を敗拉す I 幾办 53 ポル奶如は妃似ぱの粑軏 |： して ”， 瞅の粑扪へて脱和ビが船して似舭肥の 1 榜ぎ ^ 3 ふ 1 溧 ：1 0 モぷ ％， ぞ ： |； ド 1 ふ ％ 、 郯れ ^ ？ 卜金五卵以上ほ 1 81！ 神頌能 ^ 議に ^ 4 病 ；^ し | に爽快 3？ 您漂は | 糸製 5 元ご待旳し & 0? 式を廉 0 こじ皈舆す米國 ⑯ 加奈太 ， 墨國一手特釣販賣移轉 3 遇 |1 末次商會 7 舌芑 3 给 00： 0 0 ，， 156 2 ？08 一 811*66 1, 8811 4311 2.83， 0^ 一 . 與 1 ざ日 ， た持之し 0 衰 I ごの那 1 購 ； #5 博べ #? 臼 ； 楔 ？ ら則 \" 同 -; 崧じ數 1 米 :: 狀 ： 目めら合 ； て火 ， 著て如 , 使 ！: 人又求 ！ 村ミて - 常ソペ ー ん 18- 艦 ： 痛 ： 個 ： 阶をのニせ半 ： 似 ， し友他 ；; 用 , 1 の者 $0 5 箝出 ：, が ‘ 、 本 2 に 6?. 等 1 を海 ： 止 ？ 今 -: 十た面 ： 並 ， く进 〔 - 甚 2！ 肫 ; I を本 ， 々 :' 速 1 者 ？ 囬ム N5 はにに瞒 :： 取てめ分文 ’ 4 大な 0. 龄ミ狀 ； だ物よ增ぃ ) ¢7 白 ‘. 1 か '\" へ '/^ 十竹 1 : も用 !; ひ 1 々ぐ - す - 早 “ 位 I にバぬに多 X をせ机八り ： 配 ” ニに使しゐ人 ： 全でやにんよ似 ， 、 ， 丨來パ治 5 !) む間 ： 全て !^” 個 ： 及 ： 祀て及 ；^ 來上治 5 水 X て 〇 致 V： ャ哲 ;： 店 I 转会せ又ミ日 ？ に治 1 ' 州 ' キなレ “ す哲 2 ジ店乂に氣 ， 全 1 皎 1 しス全 ？ じ其エし間みい 1^ しを日 :; 耍う以ぃろ非ミヨし近 5 も （ たぐ丁モ V 治 '， 白 ？ 奇 ， 只 ‘' 遒龙近え用 1 其ニ犯バく I てづひ痛 ;; 淦 。 度 ， ンを人 2 効 ？ 來ナ . 氏し來よを後 .： め或 ： ごの其 -： にマ日 ;；‘ 、 〈 去い描ふ ， は奶のに同 ； 日 !！ 白 ‘ 1 根 1 2：； 诹 ” ご ， 1 効 ？ チく候 ： 皮 ：!） ま ！^ れす , 紙船 /^ 〈 ム无せにろ坍 ； な ， 多 ：; ~ わ ，' ス技 ； 城 I に七し州 5 つ川々く 4 V の 6 和 ？ に病てかし ！） 神 ;： に な右 ； 籲配て因 , 食 ”， き船妃期 5 非で及ヤ # 成渭 ， れ治 :; 小 '; に 6 の ；/， に以 I 居 ^; 慾 ; 腿 ， にしビビ常 ：” 皮 ，3 し病 ， た致に守 ： 不ュ飢手てョ ， 和拟し - 巡々成 ： 治 2 の卞用い ： 配 . 致 1 ,: 4 ぬ又 5 思し破 ？ 痛 5；1， キ染 ； 全ひこ十心い肌ひ似に 1 ' 病 ， ぬ V けは竹 . げ厂通 ， 致 ';: みマ ， 丨は ， く炎 ， や餘 ‘ サ深 ？.¢1-， にた 〈 掛 \" 王典 ： ににのし時 1 ， チ籲 〇 無 , ミ心ミ “ 化年 ” 《 州卜れ描 ,； け三九 ： 人乂如ぐて神 ； 昼 , ミ々ぐス ， イ ；2？ 地 1 のす 、 もナ御 ；; の ， 遇ぱば小 1 四桑のん府の #^ 久 ： 染 I 迄 I 全 4 ぬ能 1 … れ則ス麻 ，. 席間 ； 治 2- さヶ潘効 \" 虹初 ； 敵 1 :6 〇 5 く ': 四く聪 ： ば ）!! ド申よ隹绝ごら … き … 能マ谢ニ妙め闲乂深 ;' 白で耻 ； 五津相 : 丸 ；; 胸 !: 栽 ;:# 上と全 ’ 擦け - 坩ぐ吹 ； 前て人の川す奶 ’ 候 ： く人又炉年 ;; 田成 ？ をん I こく石候 :； 〈 1 '' せ篠 ;， 加 ， 出 1： よ見大 ：： ロろのに相 ： 供 1 . ね前 X 貫候識ぐつ近 ： 4 間 I し船し物 . い處 ： 把殆 ？ 信义師し枕 ： よ一赉 5 用 ； か來 ?. 兵迓ンこ相ご色 \\ 致 ;. 兩 V - な - 與に 4 見父 ！^ じ I； I： 1) にしわは蔵な綺 1 が々 ： し脚 ， る作候文さ全 X 候 ！^ 吿ほ | 期 ‘, に痔 ， な 6 胃 ， 共 ； なの 6 虹 ’ 如 ， 御 !' 丨 ： 亂脚 ， 候 ： 劑 5 かし州 ？ いて ， 疾 ， ぃ便 ： 瞄 ， に ！） に ”； 疝 ； 痛 ， 和 :' 拭 ' さロ ； 氣 ， 實 1 : を 1 てに 5 祕 ” 贲 V ま下 !. 瞄 ’ な血 ，… ふ 1- №5 間ミてん日之七はにし腹 ： 九 , 1 ; ざ逍 ， トンか ’ 耗 ;: 如ナ其エか瘅 ，’ 維病 2 全てざ出 ？ 八パ通 V し能 ； たのを 4 侮 | 候 ‘.' 如 ； に 1 ' 年 ：； ン効 1 ' 三治 ’; 府洛 ，， 治 11 ん血 1 : 年 2 ロ . す - 廣 ： 蒂効 ， ぬ痛ン耐的永 5 4 脚 0 : ノ能く ' 遇 1 ,- 致 ;' ぐし用 I 大 5 もァ根ミ失 〔 村 〈 くも ” 丨 1-.№1 パ松治 ,5 此氣 ，， ゼに間 5： し勸 4 ひドノ ' 以 ^ ' ル本 2 通 ： れ御 -11;\" 候 ： 入ご下 ;. 府广州 1 に广 、 用 I 候 I めした苦 I 前 ;： ト的 ；！） 期 ;！^ み未 1 ， X； ' 如 〇 ニて鹫 ： ひし井たたれしか锄 : ' の下で - 中 “ 0''' だに中ま餓 ： 甬 ： 描入 ： 全え効 ;, ロぃ满又 ' でみら峯物う下げ坂す 1 パ 8； 四以 ， み山し用 1 脚ふ山候 ； に麻ム贞で聞 ;^ パ此三き田に裥 ， さ楓ブぃ调 '， 仇 , め麻 / 2 ひ 1 \"- ンし 4 中二之 0 , 一すにな ！^ れ叨和 ； はど一 4 快 ; >№1' をま吞 ⑴ たビ蒔疮 ： 皮廣ロの痔 1 11-； 靼 ？ いひ坊 “ ぃく ， る ^ レ七黹 ； き - 炒 ， 喊 ， | 1 ？ 臈丸 — 土針則一個三仙 0 >4 8^ 11 18 么 3“ 气 V :: 臂い 9 スい丄 VI 典 15 1 笋咕 ！ ？ 共 - 」 先生の發明にして世に嫌千 1X11 一 ^ ろ和なきは资緊の配ぞるあ |！ なる & X ん , ふ V い 4 、 やふ ，5 V んぢべんぴ ？ げ , 【 II ― 知 、 一誉性の打骐病も全治し便秘は通じ下痢 ， は止まり父後邪を治す (1 んほいてて 5 〜 111 い擎く 4 、 ニ 1 は ， ロ之了 0 くそ ，， ， 一日本の 1 にして觔能害 — 譯せ中蜃もせす白人社待へ夫れ I 、 そあひ ：' ねひ 5 、 しょ -. -4 ん .6 ひ 4 /-19 \\ ，^ 1^ ， 厂 '^ ょ - 夫れ各傅へて非常 |： 贫货备っ 1 弘 | 期 31 っでもぁ ； じつ 2 し 5 11 ら 5 ケゐぐ 6 \\ 5 |： 鉍 6 ふ - 一 I 4 、 1 く貫で 『 6 ますか货 |： 我篠府劑及び捋胳凡の疑なき不思通の効カは旣に | 4-2 浐 4,1 № 4 : 丨成んて 07 ： 仍だい |19 てん一良 |1 く仁ん 4 んだ ー 厂攻險原則一 ; % I ょ高 〒 此渚展 — し '^ の 44 6 掄へ诗 1 X 動ろ — を以て强んに使用せらる - に至れ 4 れ货に本州が世上 , , \\1 員一一人 、 ゎ肇鼇 ％/ て肇て 、 ざん 6 ぃ了 -1 ん 6 ん又鲁ニこ 2 そ山記の 1 に化敗 * る 3I^ は和て駆 I: 1 在 !>* 篠原劑定值五十仙一弗郵枕一個三仙 №1 !' い丨た ‘ (: いそし 9 け ？，0 〇 せい 1 令 \\ く |9 ん 1 2 ぴや 6 ？ く二ねいぢ ^ ん ， 本州の働きは人体の飢梂ご血液を消良に 1 循環を能くせしむろ |： 依 6 病哿を枨本 |： 退治全硭すリ V 4. っけひユびや 、 25 ¢> 1 けん 1.¢ V 臂肇 , ゐ — んけ #' は ， 键 1 八丨 5 ろ <1 くい ~？ ョ ー マチス 、 ^^ 脚氣 、 皮炻病等は効邸敁も速か |： 脊髄 ， 神敉笳 、 肺 、 心臓 、 肋脱ビ雖も全癒し 3, し ， 5 し 0 |， や 5 6，# 办い #: れ疒丨觭 4 』 ふ 0 ムひ ，5 $* けつれ V % 1.？6 削俱 ， 火俱 、 打摈なで 1： 至 6 ては沉に効果を頫はし婦入病 |： 用ゐて決して他の ^ 與の如く 2：： 肌を番するこごなく快疮す 12"

Kobayasiii, Editor and Proprietor. RACE PREJUDICE. We ho VO heard very mueh ot.lnje concerning race prejudice. We have been told that this is the orte great, insnrnimintablo difficulty in the way of a belter understanding and closer fellowship among the nations whoso representatives dwell up and down Hie Pacific slope. Now, just what is this thing which we call race prejudice ? There are two things which form the considerable part of this situalion, namely-ignorance and artistic disgust. Ignorance ol the mental habits and 'social ambitions, and disgust with the strange pigmentation and contour of the faces of the people of the other races. Now the most troublesome of these two is ignorance, there is an old proverbial stanza which says: “A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring.” And our ignorance is not so much lack of information as it is lack of “deep drinking.” Of all the pits into which the pilgrim through this life may fall there is none quite jig dangerous us that of ignorance. Most of our personal ills, our famines and times of stringency, our crimes and oppressions are traceable to the deceits of ignorance. We are ignorant* of the laws of health, ignorant, of the powers at work about us in the physical world; ignorant of the mystical soul-life, and as a consequence wo cripple our bodies, we impoverish the land and pervert the natural and wholesome development of the lives about us by the misuse of the power of suggestion. If wo knew the laws of health, the laws of nature and the laws of the mind how much more of a paradise we could moke of what is now at times u very disagreeable world in which to live. We could make it a place, indeed, where it would be possible for “brethren to dwell together in the bonds of ponee.” Now the matter is not different when it comes to the question of the mingling of the races. We may know the geographical situation of a race, we may be acquainted with its history, know something of its language, have road of its army and navy, and yet this sort of information may ho the very thing which stands in the way of a com-1 pjete understanding of that race. We must “drink deeper,” we must know something of the mental temper, the reflective life, of the soulerics of that race before we may be said to understand it. For illustration, how mueh does the average Californian know of the lives of the thousands of Chinese and Japanese who live in the valleys up and down this Pacific Coast? What, after all, does ho know of those people whose industry has filled these valleys with the glory ol a splendid agriculture? In one sense Californians know them very well. They have heard about the \"picture brides,” the gambling dens and the dee]) caverns in our cities where are hidden away the spoils of citizenship and the sanctity of womanhood. They have heard that every Japanese working in the homes or on the farms is a soldier with his uniform hidden under the disguise of overalls and jumper, ready to be exposed at a moment’s notice; that every conk is a spy seeking information which may he of use to his government in time of national misunderstanding; that Japanese do not keep their word, that they have been known to steal and commit murder and these added together make very undesirable citizens. The unfortunate part of this is, of course, that some of these things are true and some are maliciously false, but no distinction is made. “It is better to know less than to know so much that is false.” Now it requires no lengthy argument to show that such so-called knowledge is not calculated to bring about a mutual understanding -between the Japanese and Chinese on the one hand and the Americans on the other. Doubtless similar misinformation is far spread among these races concerning America and the Americans. We are told, on the basis of this misunderstanding, that the. Japanese and Chinese are “different” and that any approach towards social or other intercourse is to be discouraged at all times. Such knowledge is really ignorance and such ignorance is the dark background on which the picture of race prejudice is projected. There is yet another factor in race prejudice with which we have In deal. At first it seems hardly worth consideration but upon further investigation it will be found, after all, to lie the most troublesome of all. This factor is disgust with the color and shape of the fane. Yellow peril, the negro problem—what are these but color problems? We dislike the Japanese because the color of his skin is yellow and the negro because his is black. Many young Americans .1 • a.B 3it 11 i{S%;i%!!S^ 81 ; !-| Sil 11 |\"« : lal;:3i*j I$%S m® «Ser 2H* ■*•* ««««*««; |j»\" f a* ffl i BpJ»|s|»||sir«ss; i i suites X | S§ii jj; + i + y| f a- ?? 8n sassisg ilizAtioD and all its achievements! Nobody takes this creature ser- ' iouslv. When it is mentioned, it is always in a humorous vein. While we are with the namatu. we might speak of the influence 1 this creature has had upon the architecture of Japan. “Specifically worthy of mention in this connection is the curvature given to the old stone castle walls. It approximates that theoretical curve known in geometry ns the parabolic, which gives the greatest stability against earthquakes, and which at the same time conforms most nearly to the line of beauty. As another illustration of how earthquakes stimulate architectural ingenuity, I may mention the way in which the fivestoried pagodas, some’ of them over a hundred feet high, are built to endure the severest shocks. These high structures have never ly-en known to fall. The principle on which they are built is the combination of an inverted pendulum with an ordinary pendulum, which is said to minimize the effect of any tremor. The principle is emliodied in a heavy, massive piece of timber, suspended somewhat freely from tin 1 top and resting on a pivot below, so that in ease the ground shakes, the whole structure sways in such a manner as to maintain its equilibrium.” ' I As to ordinary dwelling houses, Leroy Beaulieu says: Nothing can exceed the simplicity of the construction of these habitations, which only differ from ihose of the townspeople by their lofty and heavy thatched roofs, which usually contain a granary, and are supported by very stout wooden pillars, rising from a heap of stones placed oil the' bare ground, without any attempt at a foundation. Those walls only which support the gable are solidly built with clay kept together by a bamboo lattice. The two principal facades stand back about a yard inside the pillars, and consist of paper screens which slide backwards and forwards. At night, or in stormy weather, these screens are replaced by wooden shutters. 'I lie whole front is | thrown wide open when the weather is fine or there is a ray of sunshine, so that passers-by may have a full view of (he interior.” Finally, a word as to the fauna and flora. So far ns archaeology shows, Japan was never inhabited by monstrous mammals encli as threatened man in other parts of the earth. Nor have there existed: impenetrable jungles so common on the continent of Asia and the | Americas. Even giant trees have not existed. The fiercest animals ( the inhabitants had to face and conquer were the bear, boar and wolf. The lirst named were pushed into the northern island of Hokkaido in time unknown to us. Neither the boar nor the wolf are now numerous. Japan has always been a land of graceful trees, artistic flowers and melodious song birds. The pine mid cranes, the plum (awe) and I warblers, the bamboo and sparrows, have been sneh common subjects, of onr artists that no one has failed to see them. Then wc have the| cherry, wisteria, lotus, eulnlia, eamelin. patrinia and not the least, our glorious chrysanthemum. Maples with their fantastic leaves and varied hues add to the picturesque nature full of winding and sounding brooklets, beginning with cataracts large and small. Such in brief was the physical environment in which Japanese culture grew. (To be continued.) VAMATO ICTIIIIASIII. SHUTTING THE GATES TO THE FOREIGNER The Hurnett-Dillingham immigration hill is an attempt to reverse the immigration pulley of the t tilled States. It is just as reactionary as it dares to he. It is the first deliberate and concerted effort that has been made by “little Americans” to shut the gates in the faces ' of honest, healthy and industrious • Europeans who want to cast in , theiHot with the Republic. Tho liliTiiry test in the hill is a subterfuge—a very silly one. It is absurd that farmers and mechanicsfrom Russia, Germany or elsewhere —who are morally and physically qualified for American citizenship —should ho barred out by a spell-i ing book when they get to Kllis Island.

It is only by the most persistent struggle that these young men so trained are able to free themselves from this miscducation. Now. as that color shades up from the negro wo think, naturally, that the character likewise undergoes a similar change and its evolution into higher spheres is announced by this outward change, in the pigmentation of the skin. Well, under such tuition it is no wonder that we find ourselves face to face with what at first seems to bo an unsurmountablc barrier across the path which seems should lend to complete understanding. If it took the Romans two hundred years to understand the invading barbarian, wo may expect it to take some years for us to understand each other here on this const. We piust educate, educate, patiently but persistently. Wo must seek to sec each tie- other’s good and tryto live above the level of such prejudice. , Berkeley, Cal. HARVEY It. OUT, JAPANESE CIVILIZATION. Physical P.nvironmcnl. Next, we shall briefly speak of the environment in which Japanese culture evolved. Spencer, speaking of the relation of environment to the evolution of man, says: “Life in general is possibh ly between certain limits of temperature; and life of the higher kinds is possible only within a comparatively narrow range of temperature, maintained artificially if not. naturally. Hence, social life, presupposing ns it does not only human life but that life vcglal and animal on which human life depends, is restricted by certain extremes of cold and heuj.” But it was Thomas Buckle who was undoubtedly the first to bring in relief the unmistakable influence of “the gem-rid aspect of nature” upon human cultures. It “produces its principal results by exciting the imagination and suggesting those innumerable superstitions which arc the great obstacles to advancing knowledge.” Further, “Looking in this way at the human mind ns affected by the aspects of nature, it is surely a remarkable fact that all the great early civilizations were situated within and immediately adjoining the tropics, where those aspects are most sublime, most terrible, and where nature is, in every respect, most dangerous to man. Indeed, generally, in Asia, Africa and America the external world is more formidable than in Europe.” As a general sociological principle neither Spencer nor Buckle is to be denied, ns to the truth of their statements. With such a preliminary remark, we shall now examine the environment that • played a part along with heredity in the evolutionary process of the Japanese race and their culture. Old Japan was no more than 140,000 square miles in area, but was composed of no less than eight hundred islands of volcanic origin, “lying off the northeastern const of the Asiatic continent in the shape of a longitudinal curve.” Its climate is neither too severe nor too mild. The rainfall is plenty for cultivation but not too copious. The Island Empire, ns it might be easily supposed, is extremely mountainous, rising some times as high as the Mount Fugi, unique for its beauty and now famous the world over. None of the peaks, however, like those on the continent are awe-inspiring. They never terrified the inhabitants nor have they rendered them to remain passive. Nature was to be enjoyed; it was not to conquer the islanders. The insular nature of the land makes it at once obvious that water everywhere surrounds it. Its eastern shores are washed by the gentle waters of the Pacific, while its western shores are washed by the intermingled waters of the seas of Japan and Okhotsk and that of Yellow Sea. Thus it was that cultural drifts, including man from the continent, were often cast upon the shores of Japan from time immemorial. To its eastern shores the warmth-giving Black Current brought similar drifts from other parts of the world. Japan formed a sort of oasis in the midst of these diverse waters and its inhabitants were or have become a sea-folk of Asia. The volcanic origin of the land made it inevitable that its inhabitants had lo face the frequent occurrence of earthquakes, eruptions and tidal waves, in addition lo hurricanes, tempests and what not. A glance at the formidable array of these phenomena as presented by , Okujimu in his “History of Natural Destructive Phenomena in Jn- : pan,” may suffice to shook the oversensitive. However, so far as the Japanese race is concerned, those terrible events have had only a ■ happy result; they stimulated the activity of their imagination but ■ did not “impair the intellectual powers.” To illustrate: “The very ■ - origin of earthquakes is ascribed rather jocosely to the movement of ■ la huge, phlegmatic catfish, imiiuuiij living in mud beneath the crust ■| of the earth. When its barbels twitch, seismology makes record of 1 1 fresh shocks; but should the hideous monster feel inclined to raise its Jbroad, glum head in its dozing on tin: muddy bottom, then woo to civ- ' THE JSPTOJESE AMERICAN ENGCI9H SECTION. \\m 0 i m fit m i lea. They have aimed solely at keeping unwholesome people from coming. The Bumctt-Dillingham hill is the entering wedge for tt new and bad policy—a policy of general exclusion. If this literary test clause is allowed to stand, the way will ho open to various kinds of captions and whimsical restrictions—all tending toward a complete stoppage of that tide of human strength and enterprise that has been flowing into this country from Europe for the last four hundred years, and that has made America what it is. Nothing is more stupid than the prejudice to which this bill makes its appeal. Tt appeals to the utterly unfounded notion that the social and political evils that afflict the ' i United States are due to the “foreign element.” The truth is, of coarse, that all of us, except the ; Red Indians, belong to the foreign element in various degrees of hereditary remoteness. And there is . absolutely no truth in the contention that the newcomers are more disposed to crime, shifllessness or any particular kind of moral per- ; I versify than the oldcomers and 11 their descendants are. 'I As for the rudimentary literary i culture, the American public. school system exists to supply that Hand no honest man, woman or ■ child should be excluded from the i j United States for the lack of it.

Only time and closer intercourse are the possible factors which solve the race problemn. Customs and understanding would slowly and (painfully, with the assistance of (time, find solutions of this question No law however cleverly it is made, nor any treaty however cordially it is made, would fail to accomplish anything towards the solution of this race prejudice. The power of time and habit upon the subject of race problem could be easily found in the United States The foundamental race problem in this country is that of the negro. At the time of Civil War, what prejudice was against the Negro, we all know. How the colored race was treated even after tne Civil War, we are aware of. The right and freedom that were given by the law to the Negro after the Civil War, are little or nothing compared to the rights and freedom the Negro enjoy to-day. The recent decision of the United Supreme Court declaring the Civil rights act of 1875, unconstitutional, makes no difference whatever to the Negro. They have earned by the assistance of time, such rights and freedom that they enjoy to-day. The time assisted the white people to mingle with the race and\" know more of the people. And the habit of seeing the Negro among the white people, by and by lessened the prejudice of the white people against the black. This effect of time and contact is true in the racial -question of any country and whatever race is involved in the question. To try to abolish the race hatred by making a new law or by making another treaty with another nation, is an attempt unworthy of any clear sighted statesman. They could ma!# several new laws and make various new treaties about the subject. But those laws and treaties, would do nothing for the solution of the race question. The race question of Japanese in the United States could not be stopped nor solved by a new law. No one man or one government with all its power and strength could aolve this question. The solution of this matter, requires the assistance of time, and by slow and painful effect of habits and contact, the matter would be solved at the end. It is not a kind of problem which could be solved in one day, nor in one year.

The House took up the five-power loan for discussion, anci acting Premier Tan Chi-jui made a brife. explanation of it. Interpellations were showered upon the acting Premier; but he merely repeater that'the loan contract was formerly approved by the previous Senate, and so it is not in violation of tlx Provissonal Constitution. The Nationalists who-are against the five-power loan,- were greatly . offended at the explanation of tin : acting Premier and sent for Premiei Chao Pin-Chuan, Minister of Fi- ; nance, Chou Hsiao-hsi and Wai ■ Minister Lu Cheng-hssang, but,they ■ did not come to the House.

A SURVEY OF 1 HE JAPANESE QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA By J. Sovkda mid T. Kamiva. CHAPTER 11. ('oulnilions Itroiifflil Forward. There are many reasons raised for the exclusion of the Japanese, hut the chief ones may he summarized under the following four headings: 1 Political. 2—Economical. J—Social. 4—Racial. FIRST: The Political Contentions. (a) The Democratic party coming into power, changes came in the way of dealing with the subject, because it bad been laying great stress on individual state rights. The progressives in California turned a deaf ear to the words of the President, and Mr. Bryan’s personal persuasion was of little avail except that the wording of the Alien Land Bill was made more diplomatic and the clause allowing three years lease was inserted at the request of the agricultural community of California. The bill being signed by the (lovenior, it fell to the United States government to decide, and it was placed in a very difficult position. Again it seems to have placed Hie final settlement on the shoulders of the court. Jt is much to be regretted that a question of such international importance should be made a subject of p. rty polities. and not be settled lie fore it became so serious. fb) Labor unions in San Francisco were ever active in working against the Japanese, and so as not to lose their favor, politicians in California bad to support the bill, with the exception of a few, such as the Senator from San Diego, who stood for justice and fought so bravely to the end. If the Japanese had had the power of voting things might have been different, so that their helpless situation is much to be pitied. (c) Some believe that democracy must be a homogeneous body, so that the foreign element such as the Japanese—must be excluded. But if we turn our eyes to the already existing heterogeneous condition of the American population, composed of negroes. Latins, Slavs. Jews, and what not. the argument falls to the ground. America is strong enough to assimilate different races; and the essential feature of a democracy being equality, it is against its nature to be exclusive or partial. Hi l If is much to be regretted that fears, quite unfounded, have been entertained especially sine* the late war in contrast to tiesympathy shown Japan before and during her life and death struggle. To say that Japan is a warlike nation is absurd. What other nation enjoyed peace for so long a time ns she? If she was forced to go into war, it was solely for her self-preservation and for the Far Eastern peace. If she bad not stood up or bad not been .successful in tin* )nt«* war, what would have been her own fate, as well as that of China? The history of tin* world would have been quite different. It is often said that the Japanese are too patriotic and loyal, but it is not a mere blind patriotism, being founded on the obedience to authority, law and 11nstate. If the Japanese won; admitted to lake part in the American iKidy politic they would make the best of citizens. It has been officially shown that the Japanese in California are the most law-abiding of all immigrants. Yet all sorts of criticisms are piled up on them and groundless fears are aroused because of the selfish purposes of mischief makers and of those who reap benefits, .-ither directly or indii Ily. through the creation of sensations and preparations for war. (a) As the population of the United Slates is now of considerable size, and as there are undesirable elements coming in from all quarters THE JAPANESE AMERICAN ENGLISH SECTION. of the world, the lime lies come for her to place restriction on immigra- ( tion. This contention has much weight when we consider that people I of extreme socialistic ideas and anarchistic inclinations might, some day 1 be a cause of danger to fie* republic. But the restriction should b«* 1 placed equally and fairly on nil, without any discrimination of race or * nationality. It is the unfair discrimination that is most resented by the Japanese nation. ( fb) Natural resources must be preserved for- posterity. Therefore, to let the Japanese buy up all the best land would be a disaster. It. is j true that resources must not be wasted, but the Japanese buying a few. thousands out. «»f hundreds of millions of acres and increasing the t resources of the country, should not be discouraged, especially by such I a big country as America, having such an extent of land lying idle. 1 (e) Some arguments, based on Hie superiority of the Japanese as to (heir hard work, their special skill in raising fruit and vegetables, 1 their extra exertion in case of urgency, etc., s*-m to give rise to the' fear that those who compete with them must surely fail. But this is, an exaggeration of facts, for the lines along which the Japanese arc making their success arc quite different from those in which the Ameri-, 1 cans are working. They arc not competing but doing something for the mutual benefit of both nationalities. fd) Then comes the fear of absenteeism being encouraged if the 1 1 land is entrusted to Japanese hands. tli<- landlords all going eastward 1 to New York or Europe to enjoy their lime. This, also, is an exaggera- \\ lion of actual facts, for even if the Japanes be excluded, so long as i t here are other people who would lease the land the same thing would' ‘ occur, if it ever does occur. I '■ Attacks, such as the Japanese bring satisfied with lower wages '••r Hu* hind deteriorating if Japanes. come info a district, arc quite \\ contrary to the actual state of things. Japanese get the same wages i as Americans, if not. higher. They an* paying higher rent and an-' going in steadily for improvements on tin- land, and thus have in-' -creased the price of the land in many localities. Another statement | that tin* Japanese use their own goods and send their money back i ‘home, is refuted by Hie very fact that they buy the land and make i I so main investments in America Hranling that they send back a 1 r part of their savings, flu* amount is insignificant compared with that' ; sent home by immigrants of many European countries. In any case, j the best fruit* of the labor of immigrants remain permanent assets] 'of America: what little they send back to Europe or Japan is. in «» broad economic sense, an insignificant part thereof. ■‘•linn- |m i iil«- on I; ;frn-r the art of : photography lins reached Japan, Hh* above method of indirect innr- .

In accordance with the decision i of the last general conference of tlie International Sunday School i I‘onvention held in Switzerland. • the next conference will be called •in Tokyo. In this context the , authorities concerned state that . hitherto such international conventions have been held only in the countries of the first-class powers. It is an honor to this empire, therefore. that the next International Sunday School Convention is to Vie 1 1 ■1 d in lie- rapil.d of 11. ■ count i\\ . • The date for the convention is not yet fixed, but it will probably be held in May. IDlfi. On this occasion not only all the Sunday School children of the empire, but the representatives of the different foreign Sunday Schools will lie in attendance. to the number of more than ten thousand. A regrettable fact i in this connection is that Tokyo is devoid of a public hall large •enough to receive such a great gath- • ering. On such an occasion as a general conference of the Women’s Patriotic Association, tents have so far been utilized. This may !*<• all right so far as any assembly of a domestic nature is concerned, but no such provisional arrangement would answer the purpose of an international convention. The anthor- - dies as well as the publicists of Tokyo are said, accordingly, to be contemplating the construction of a gram! public hall by the time the convent ion is to he called. THE EMPEROR’S BIRTHDAY. • The Official Gazette announces that ‘ August 31st the Kinperor’s birthday will ho observed as a national holiday, hut the formal celebration will be postponed till October 31st. which has been selected as the official day for the celebration of the imperial birthday. The banquet on the Bnipcror’fi birthday will be given on October 31st ami . the birthday congratulations will also la* received on that day. Foreign Visitors to Japan.

A SURVEY OF THE JAPANESE QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA I'>.v .1. Suveda and T. Kamiya. Il must nlso lie rirnicmbprcd that linliniitrd natural resources and a hoimtlless tract of land in the United States afford ample room for a trreal number of people, and it is better for her and for the (tenoral interest of humanity that her resources he opened and utilized. ■d) It is admitted that the Japanese are not inferior, but arc different, and, it is deemed better to avoid intermingling, and if they intermingle they must become thoroughly Americanized. To keep the different races apart is an impossibility in this day of rapid and easy communication. Of course, no exception can be raised to the placing of Strict tests for admission, provided they nr discriminntorv CHAPTER III. The Solution. FIRST: There must be a better understanding or the question by the United States. Even the people in California do not view the matter in a true and comprehensive manner, and therefore it. is no wonder tin- people in the Middle West and Eastern States, being far away and less directly concerned, are still less informed, although they may entertain a better feeling toward the Japanese in general. It is natural that the general American public should believe more readily in what their own people say than what is told by foreigners, and here is the danger of mistaken ideas and distorted facts influencing the minds of the people in general. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the Press and the public opinion of the West should be supplied with true and honest facts, so as to avoid misrepresentation being spread out to the other states. The people, being the leading power and each state having constitutional autonomy, the public opinion in general, and especially in California, must be well guided, in order to save the East from falling into errors and to facilitate the actions of the Federal government. in matters of international relations. The easiest way to solve the question would be that of naturalization, although this suggestion had better come from the American side and with necessary safeguards. As regards other questions constitutionally entrusted to the Federal government, such ns the due modification or perfection o£ treaties and conventions, there is no room for doubt that the United States government will do its utmost to settle the matter with honor and satisfaction to both countries. THIRD: The Social Contention. fa) It is said that the standard of life of the Japanese is too low. and it has a lowering effect on that of the Americans. Beginning' as wage earners on the lowest steps of the social ladder, the Japanese had to lie frugal and live simply; but they. too. know well enough how to enjoy comforts and luxuries if they can afford them, and there are already many who live more luxuriously than some other immi-' grants. (It) Then it is said that the status of the Japanese women is very low and that they an* used for heavy work. Lot it be here remembered i that the Japanese woman’s sphere lies in the home; while they do 1 not take part in social activities, yet in their hojncs they hold ns im-' portent positions as their American sisters. Moreover! changes are taking place in this respect and the Western ideas are fast getting’ a hold. (c> The Japanese are saiil to he immoral, going in for gambling! and other vices. This may Is; true in a few cases, but these, evils' are not the monopoly of the Japanese. Vigorous measures are being, the masterpieces of the world, from t Homer to Kipling: from IMato to j Bergson. I p from Creek mythoi-1 ogy down to French novels, they j are not inaccessible in vermicular to the farm hands in a remote province. Tin* works of Maeterlinck.! D'Annunzio. Corky and Shaw are 1 eagerly read and appreciated, as ' well as those of Sienkiewiez. Dosto- > ievskv. Iljsen and Tolstoy. Japan r is indeed a veritable pantheon of j all forms of civilization and sin* can furnish you with an object lesson of every item of culture on earth, both ancient and modern, such as. forex- 1 ample, in the field of religion, nn- i tore worship, ancestor worship. | Huddhism and Christianity. Jap-, anese civilization at present is* neither purely Oriental nor Occidental. but a hybrid, so to speak.* as her people are such. Hul this* hybriditv is nothing monstrous. Ii , simply signifies, on the contrary, tie* union of two divergent currents of civilization, whose starting point * nobody knows where. Tin* one 1 current for certain that took the . easterly direction lm» finally set-, tied in the Japanese islands, passing through India and China. The ‘ other current, going clear round s the Western world, through t’hal- 1 dea. Egypt. Palestine. Asia Minor.. Urecce. Italy and other European nations, and sweeping over tin* new t world of America, lias eventually reached tin* land of Japan. And thus the divergent titles of civilization bad to mingle after a long, long separation, their concordant currents on the sunny shore of Nippon, whose spirit is conversant both with the East and the West. Animated by this fact, the JapHUesc people must take upon themselves a still harder task of produc- j ing a new superior civilization out \"f tin* two distinct types with which sin* is intrusted, for she lias ad- ‘ vantage over all other nations for 1 her capacity of sound judgment } and impartial love, geographically.*, racially and historically. In rclig- j ion. in philosophy, in science, in , art. as well as in industrial, commercial and social achievements. r •Japan must champion tin* Asiatic* peoples as sin* has been doing, and i build up a civilization that trails- , ‘•ends all nations, intellectually morally and spiritually. Tin* nineteenth century civiliza-' tion was the achievement of tin* 1 European nations, and this single j fact bloated tin* pride of the white r race and gave rise to tin* miscon- j ccption of the innate superiority of .. 11n* Aryan race overall other stocks 1 Of mankind. But the sweeping vie- » lory gained over the material I world, which characterizes tin* en f lightenment of tin* preceding ecu- j tury. has nearly exhausted its ten- , sion. and the world is moving t«»ward a new life with new aspira- r tion for something spiritual. Japan * must stand forth as the leader of o taken by the Japanese themselves l„ remedy all sue), ...rial evils, and results have already shown themselves in many loealiti. \\„ human being is free from faults and short: mgs. and if the Japanese are frankly told of their faults, they are most grateful and readv to rectify them. (d 1 Then the Japanese, it is claimed, have no religion and are apt to break faith. To this it can be replied in the same way as above. Here it might be well to mention that there nre a great many Christians among the Japanese population in America. FOURTH: And the last,\"but not the least, cones the contention of race. (a) The most common one is the non-assimilation theory, and the supporters of this theory declare that true assimilation cannot be effected except by intermarriage. But if thought and sentiment agree, .different races can assimilate. Supposing intermarriage is absolutely .necessary for assimilation; there are already many eases of inter,marriage between the Japanese and the Americans; and there would •be many more if it wen- not for the artificial and unjust restrictions -placed by law and usage. In truth, the Japanese are the most assimilative. and their whole history is that of assimilation of different ideas and civilization. It is an admitted fact that Japan has gone far to assimilate the civilization of the East with that of the West, and , her example is being followed by other nations ia the Orient. If any- . body entertains doubts on this point, it would be well for him to , have just 11 look at the Japanese children bom in the United States. .They are Americans in every respect except color Before passing i judgment as to the aasimilability of any race we must allow at least a generation. , (b) It is said “the United States has bad too much of the racial question, especially in the solution of the negro problem. Moreover .the negro has nothing behind him. unlike the Japanese who are backed by a strong government and nation”. To this let it be repeated that .the power of assimilation of the United States is strong enough to solve any race question; and surely the country that even fought for the .negroes cannot deny the admission of the Japanese on mere racial grounds. (e) Some say that tie- United States has already too many people from Europe, and that after the Panama Canal is opened in 1315, the country may be over-flooded with European immigrants. This .may be true, but this cannot be given ns a reason for placing restrictions upon and excluding the Japanese who are alread> in the States, unless it is proved that tile Japanese are far more undesirable than other immigrants, which is unwarranted bv actual facts. Is it a wise mid patriotic policy to exclude the intelligent, orderly and loyal elements apd welcome those who are ignorant, idle and anarchistic? MISSION OF NEW JAPAN. prehistoric past. This fuel, of racial 1 admixture still retains n trait of I eclectic trend in t!n*ir mental make- I up. Eclecticism is not had. if it dors not rctmiiu skin-dorp. Inil goes on creating a superior product with a combination of select materials, for invention is nothin? hut a new combination, psychologically, of old substances. And such an eclecticism was the role played by -lapan in her historical growth. Hindu religion and Chinese civilization wen* introduced into .Japan and flourished there between the seventh and tenth centuries. Hut they could not overwhelm the originality of the Yamato race, and the result was the modification—or rather, creation—of Japanese Huddhism ihrough snch geniuses as Honen. Shinran and Niehiren of tin* thirteenth century. The new Huddhism arose with a protestant zeal and reformation movemenl. Tin* ascetic and intellectual religion of “inner light’* was turned into an optimistic and emotional religion of salvation through faith and love. < bines** classics. Taoism and Confucianism, seemed to devastate the whole of mental soil and threatened to absorb the restless spirit of Yamato into their likeness—the sluggish and slavish worship of the past. Japan soon put aside the deadly burden of mental slavery and interpreted the ancient sages in her own way. This feature of Japanese traits is well attested by a remarkable fact that the Chinese language has never 1 been spoken m Japan even with - such a pcrvaleriee of Chineoe lit .' erature during the Ashikaga and I Tokugawa Shoinmates. except bv a few fanatic pedants such as Sorai i in the Tokugawa era. who at- >■ tempted to speak Chinese nmomr his dilettante friends, whereas the • medieval Europe was a slave of > Eat in. not only in scholarly com- \\ mini motion, but spoken as a court I langtMge.

S’angminism. a i Socratic philosophy produced in •' China in the sixteenth century, has | never set a deep root in the native I place, but its Chinese peculiarities! 1 being largely eliminated by Japan- 1 esc scholars, exercised a lasting influence during the Tokugawa era. t Yangminism is no longer anything 1 but Japanese in its moral force. f If a racial quality could be said r to have something to do with aptitude for absorbing with ease t the civilization of a similar race, n •lapan would stand forth for its t witness, since she has a blood of v the white in her veins and achieved 1 such a herculean task of assimila- t tion with European civilization in s so short a time. In literatim*, for v instance, educated youths of Japan t today arc not unacquainted with n , The Japanese nation, since her obscure beginning, has trodden the path of ha* upward march for twenty-fiv nturies. vet her service to humanity has scarcely been more than as a reservoir of • Iricntul civilization. Owing to her insular condition it was a hermit life she lived, being secluded from the touch with world-movements. Her greatness and glory are not in the past, hut reserved for tin- future. And now we assert emphatically that il is time for her to awake to a fuller realization id' her mission in the world. The mission of a nation, as we said before, is largely determined by her geographical and historical situations, as well as by her peculiar genius. Japan, a long chain of archipelagoes stretched in the fore, front of the Asiatic continent, stands m u as though a sentinel of Asia in the Far East The sentinel that roronnoilcrx the movements of 1 the foe is one that guides the ends- - sary id' pci Japan, in her i unique position, joins hand in hand the East and tli.

N0 49f>2 this new movement, for a new turn in civilization requires a new nation to take the lead. And its faint indication we have already seen in such an attempt as by N.

Exploiting in such an attempt as this and proving tin* high degree of their intelligence and moral efficiency in many other ways, they must disillusion the selfconceit of the Caucasian race in s order to awaken the self-conscious-ness of other Asiatic nations, whose natural ability needs not succumb even for a moment to tin* racial .aristocracy of European nations. And thus wc hope to see tin* brotherhood of all mankind on equal footing, without which it is impossible to take its shape. In short, to bring up her sister nations in Asia to the sweetness and light of world civilization is tin* predestined mission of New .Japan, _______ R n * RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.

Their presence creates friction. . . . If. in the course of this analysis, it were found that the superior ability and aggressiveness of the Japanese, their successful racial team work had aroused the envy and hatred of certain classes: if it was shown that the national poise and dignity. the sensitive pride, the lack of humor among the Japanese, had created resentment in the easygoing. back-stopping West; if these facts were cited to shed light upon the psychology of at | titude to immigrants of color, it is not fair to extend the deductions to cover the entire held of immigration.

And “like the Negro.” says he. “the Japanese are a disturbing element,\" But be is frank enough to admit that in the wise of the Negro it is his inferiority that creates the eon tempt which in turn creates friction. In the ease of the Japanese, it is “their superior ability*’ that creates the envy and hatred id’ certain classes. These certain classes in his mind are doubtless inferior whites. lint Mr, Woehlke’s interpretation of the psychology of the situation is a novel, indeed, a startling one. To him both the contempt shown for inferiority ami the envy and hatred of superiority alike find a moral justification, that is. in his •wn Western elhieal»e:Kle. They would not be characterized bv him as “ignoble.” What the whit- man ones or thinks is justifiable so long ;.s tin- suffering party is “colored ” Brant he is right, such philosophy is m-w to most of ns. As a matter of I’ael. the civilized portion of mankind is trying its utmost to emerge from the primitive and barbarous political philosophy. “might is right.” In proof t this. America, some fifty years -go. has herself not only freed negro slaves but has actually accepted them as her citizens on par with whites. Evidently Mr. Woehlke cares nothing for Amerifi*n justice and fairness based on !lie principle of equality. Is this been use of his foreign origin, immediate or remote.’ II- goes on to say. A Cali I’m-'iiian of Italian descent is Commissioner of Immigration here ; ” i may be added without any animus. the fact that his son is serving in : jail convicted as a “whit ■ slavI ; from the State Supreme Court and the Slab- Senate down . the sons of Italian immigrants oei i i py elective positions of honor and great importance in Calid fornia: Armenian.

Because California wants more of ■ these white immigrants it is try- • mg to keep down the barriers across the high va\\ from eastern |\\ Asia.” ' 1 The fact. Italians occupy elective positions of honor and importance | means nothing. Italians arc hu- > man beings and being human, some , of them will attain honors and i others will succumb to disgrace. The fact that the Japanese, bo , instance, fail to occupy similar po- - sit ions is not because of their own t fault. They are denied privileges - that arc freely given to others. ( Besides, native born Japanese are -til) minors. What they may attain . could not be precisely predicted, i hut they have even' possibility of i attaining what others have j achieved. What the writer is par- i tieularly interested in is in more ( (i.nereb* discussion on “What shall 1 California do with the Japanese residents within its borders?’’ It , is now no time for any one pre- , tending to be seriously interested :*i the question “to heat around the hush” Let ns face the question sqnarelv »• that we can gel somewhere.

From 1907 to 1915 prices advanced 25.9 per cent, wages only 11.5 per cent. From 1916 to 1919 prices advanced 95 per cent, wages only 50.3 per cent. This unequal increase in prices and wages continually lessens that portion which goes to Labor and increases that portion of production which goes to Capital. By applying mathematics to the figures for the last mentioned period above, we will find that while prices were increased 95 per cent and wages only 50.3 per cent, net profits increased 202 per cent, or, in other words, that portion that went to Labor increased) 50.3 per cent, but that portion which went to Capital increased 202 per cent. Here is the core of the whole evil; here is the cause of this unrest, and here is the cause of unemployment. Workingmen are not content to labor on when they see themselves getting the worse of the bargain continually. And when prices increase more rapidly than wages, wage earners arejiot able to buy back their share of production, hence in normal times it piles up in warehouses for the want of a market, then factories shut down and throw men out of work. This surplus cannot be consumed through foreign markets, because the same or worse conditions exist there, which prevents the workers of these countries from even consuming their share of their own production, especially not our surplus product. Hence those who advocate foreign markets as a remedy under the present fixed wage sys\"fem dre groping in the dark and acting blindly. Then the cause of this unrest and unemployment is the fact that wages do not keep pace with prices, that the workers do not receive their proper portion of the fruits of industry. It is now proclaimed that prices are going down, but as they go, wages come down still more and unemployment increases. Now according to the Law of Nature of Cause and Effect, to remove this unrest and unemployment we must first remove the cause, and the only way in which this can be done is to establish wages in their correct ratio to prices and to maintain that ratio constant against all fluctuations of the market. In other words, that portion which should rightfully go to Labor must be properly determined and established on a per cent basis, so that wages will always increase the same per cent as prices. Now some advance the theory of compulsory arbitration as a means of removing this industrial unrest. Compulsory arbitration will never remove this unrest unless it first removes the cause, and after that is done compulsory arbitration will be unnecessary. Those who advocate compulsory arbitration, or industrial courts, do not take these things into consideration. Their idea is to have a court sit constantly for the sole purpose of dealing with disputes arising between employes and employers. They do not even recognize this deep, underlying cause of unrest. All that they have to offer is merely a temporary settlement in the particular industry involved in the dispute before them, they cite the civil courts as an example, but the great difference between civil courts and industrial courts is that civil courts deal almost entirely with cases mvoivwtg pecuniary obligations and considerations and industrial courts would be required to deal chiefly with cases af fecting human rights and liberties. Even though this form of arbitration be voluntary, there are some principles of human rights and liberties that cannot be arbitrated, due to the fact that they are sound principles of justice. Among these I mention the following: The right for employes to receive a wage in its correct ratio to the selling price of the product, which they, aided by Capital, produce; the right to receive n wage commensurate with the profits of the employing industry; the right to be recognized as an equal to the employer in all industrial matters. j Those of us who are really interested in industrial questions from an un- biased standpoint desire to see a final settlement reached that will do nway with, for all time, all noticeable un-x-est. Therefore we expect more from industrial courts than we do from civil courts, and since they deal with human rights and liberties, we nave a right to expect more. Suppose back in 1850 some one had suggested a court to deal exclusively with questions arising between the negro slave and his master. Do you think that this would have satisfied the freedom-loving men of the North? No; they would have said: “Negro slavery is wrong; it cannot be arbitrated; it must be abolished.” So today recognize the above principles ot justice, establish then in the same sense of fairness, and industrial courts will be unnecessary. Industrial courts as proposed do not recognize these fundamental principles. What can we expect from them then? Must this dispute between Labor and Capital be parleyed with as was the slavery quesTHREE .... LAB REV tion by the Missouri Compromise, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, the Fugitive Slave Law and the Dred Scott Decision, until it will require the shedding of blood to finally settle it, as the Civil War did for the slavery question? Or shall we get to the- bottom of the question at once, strike at the root of the evil without fear, recognize these principles of justice to the employee and thus remove this cause of unrest once for all? Industrial courts cannojt do so because they are controlled by the employers, who purposely shun these all-important principles. So long as the employing and business elements of this country control our politcal and hence our industrial policies, we need never expect unbiased industrial courts. Labor, by education, must gain the support of public sentiment to the extent that public sentiment will break away from this big business control, and then force these big business interests to recognize these fundamental principles as a matter of duty and right to society at large. Industrial courts will but muddy the ssues, subject Labor to greater subversion and strengthen the power of big business in the nation. Therefore I denounce industrial courts as simply a camouflaged effort on the part** of certain employers to force their biased will upon their employes and thus delay the final and peaceful settlement of the great issue between Labor and Capital, and in its stad I advocate a deep study of the Labor question, with a view of establishing the abovestated principles of justice to the employe, that the cause of this unrest and unemployment may be eliminated and that industrial peace may be established for all time in an orderly and practical manner Modern Economy--“I don’t spend, as much money on my girl as I used to a couple of years ago.” “How’s that?” “Well, Imsed to bring her candy when I called.

At Least That Many.—Mother—' Gladys, you stood on the porch qujte i a while with that young man last! night. Gladys—Why, mother, I only! WHY? (Written for the Review) By NELLA S. WRIGHT. “It can’t be done!” * “Ah —er —What can’t be done, my dear?” absently asked Mr. John Slowman, &is eyes glued to the evening paper. “I can’t get Johnnie’s shoes or the gingham for Mabel’s school dresses this week. Oh, dear! It gets harder and harder to live on what you are getting, it seems to me!” • “Uh huh,” grunted Mr. Slowman, still reading the paper. “For heaven’s sake! Put paper down for a moment and listen to me! ” Mr. Slowman, with an obvious ef-l fort, succeeded in transferring his gaze from the printed page before him to his wife’s face. “Well, what is it?” he asked. “I want to know why it is that we are not getting enough to live on decently,” said Mrs. Slowman, her usually placid face looking quite sevei^l. “Why—why, my dear, weaar e getting by, ain’t we?” “Getting by ” scornfully repeated his wife. “Is that your idea of de-mocracy—for the working people to just ‘get by’? To merely exist?” Mr. Slowman looked at his wife in a startled way. “Why—why, what’s the matter, Mary? Are you sick or—or something?” “Yes; I am sick and disgusted with this everlasting scrimping! Why is it that we are denied even the necessities of life? Whenever it becomes absolutely necessary to buy clothes, or anything about the house, or to go to the dentist or the doctor, we have to cut down on our food allowance or go in debt. Now, what I want to know is: WHAT’S THE MATTER?” “Why—er—l don’t quite get your meaning,” stammered her husband. “Well, I’ll try to make it plainer, then. In the first place, this country in which we are living, and which we call ‘ours’, is considered to be very rich in natural resources, isn’t it?” “It is one of the richest in the world,” said Mr. Slowman, swelling out his meager chest and trying to look impressive. “And we are supposed to have a government for the people and by the people, aren’t we?” queried his wif&. “Why—er—yes, certainly,” replied Mr. Slowman, wondering with vague uneasiness just what all these questions were leading up to. “Well, why arent oil the people getting their share of the wealth of their country, then?” “Why, my dear, we all get paid wages for our work,” answered her husband, bristling defensively. “Get paid wages!” repeated Mrs. Slowman, scornfully. “Well, so do these men the people elect to run the business of their country, don’t they? Only they call their wages a *salary“, and they get paid enough to have all the necessities of life as well as most of the luxuries! Now tell me, is their work any more important than yours? Ships have to be built to said the seas and carry the goods from one country to another, don’t they? Mills and factories have to be built and operated to change the raw material into the finished product, don’t they? Don’t the fields have to be plowed, and doesn’t the grain have to be planted and harvested and turned into edible food? If there were not any workers to do these things there would be no j need of electing men to run the af- ; fairs of governments, would there? Now 'Nvhat I want to know is why those Who work with their hands and brains shouldn’t receive as much as those who work with their mouths!” Mr. Slowman looked at his wife, and rubbed the bald spot on his head reflectively. “Well, I don’t know,” he finally said, slowly; “really, my dear, I don’t know why.” “Neither do I!” snapped his wife, as she threw down her account book and went out into the kitchen to wash up the supper dishes. EDITORS MORE ACCURATE ON SPORTS THAN ECONOMICS Detroit, Mich. —“American papers today demand more accurate knowledge from their sporting editors than they do from their industrial editors,” Arthur Gleason, of New York, writer on economics, told his Detroit open Quorum audience. “When I came back to America, I took part in the Interchurch investigation of the steel strike and part of our investigation touched on newspapers reports of it,” he continued. “In 400 issues of the Pittsburg newspapers, in the heart of the strike district, we found only one based on first hand investigatwn of the , situation.” \" J stood there for a second.

E NEGRO PROBLEM. Editor of the Labor Review: The story of the discrimination against negro men and womne published in the last issue of your paper calls to my mind the whole record of the shameful treatment of a race which is as truly American as any group or class of people under the , protection of the stars and stripes. The fact is that I myself am a negro; furthermore, *1 am an American. I write and think for America, and for the welfare and interest of my race in America. I am so sorry that America’s ablest citizens, in whom the people have placed their confidence to quide the destinies of the nation, cannot delve into that question and remedy it before it is too late. Is it possible that America must be drawn into another titanic struggle between her own citizens, because of the negligence of her present statesmen to grapple with this before it is too late. Is it probable that we of the negro race shall be compelled to bear arms to receive justice from the country for whom they have willinglp shed their blood upon domestic and foreign battlefields that this nation might not perish from the earth. But on the other hand, why should a race be oppressed by the nation of whom they are citizens, and for whom they have so valiantly shed their blood. Are the atrocities of the Germans in Belgium and Northern France, which were repeated right in America, namely, Texas, Georgia, East St. Louis and Tennessee, not equally wrong in the sight of our Almighty Creator? And we all know that God is just. We belong to a Christian nation, and have our Christian ideas. We, the negroes, fought and died for the cause of France, Belgium and Poland. Is it not more logic that we should not strive to vindicate the rights of our own race, and is it not equally as just in the sight of God? Are not our good Christian mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers sending up prayers daily in the interest of our race? And God will hear these prayers however dark our face may be, for He is truly a champion of the right. One of the things that so greatly impressed me was a letter from my own dear brother, who was fighting with the American expeditionary forces in France. The following are extracts from that letter: “My dear brother: We have more than one great battle to fight as a race. One is the great battle of opinions. To think that I have seen my comrade fall at my side, and that I am sacrificing my life, and you are likewise for our country, and I received letters like this from (his fiance, of a prominent negro family) which read: “My dear, what do you think of the atrocities to our race here in America, while you are fighting to avenge the country from whom comes such horrors as those of East St. Louis, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, etc.” She also says: “I often think, is God a just God, that we as a race must be so oppressed?” Gentlemen, that young lady was one of that thirteen million negroes, and a great majority of them feel the same, and many negroes received letters of the same nature. I can produce one or two myself. Then why should we wonder at the occurrences that took place in Chicago and Washington, when we have no law to protect us? I will conclude by saying: May God hasten the day when we as a race may get justice from the country of which we are a loyal citizen. Whether by arbitration, as I prefer, or at the Supreme Bar of God. But however it may come, I am for justice A NEGRO.

Newspapers and speakers when presenting arguments against organized labor are fond of pointing to those crafts following the least intelligent policies and especially to those labor leaders who have run amuck. One notorious labor leader receives undue attention and overshadows the hundred intelligent, forward looking and unselfish leaders. The craft pursuing short-sighted policies receives publicity not accorded to the hundreds of unions based on sound business policy and run according to unquestionable principles.

The Globe and Commercial Advertiser, New York, in its issue of October 1, 1920, has reprinted the following interesting comment from Roger Ascham’s Schoolmaster, written in 1565: “And it is a pity that commonly more care is had, yea, and that among very wise men, to find out rather a cunning man for their horse than a cunning man for their children. They say nay in word, but they do so in deed. For to the one they will gladly give a stipend of 200 crowns by the year and are loath to offer to the other 200 shillings. God that sitteth in heaven laugheth their choice to scorn and rewardeth their liberality as it should. For he suffereth them to have tame and well ordered horses, but wild and unfortunate children, and therefore in .the end they find more pleasure in their horses than comfort in their children.” AMERICANIZATION. The overuse and misuse of this term has destroyed the effect of the expression which should mean so much. Americanization should convey the idea of progress toward and realization of the ideas which have actuated American life and history. Unfortunately the term has been used so often in connection with plans and purposes which signified little if anything except the lack of real American spirit in the minds of the proposers. Worse still, the term has been applied when the real intention had nothing to do with better preparation for citizenship, but rather with the development, of national prejudices. The American Federation of Teachers has not been guilty of using the term lightly. There has been an honest attempt to develop such educational policies and standards as would carry out the best meaning of this sentiment. PEOPLE’S DRUG CO., LTD. Cor.

JACKSON, A Negro Worker A great many Americans are very much concerned about Americanizing foreigners by inculcating in them the principles of Americanism. They need not worry over this matter', for “deeds” still “speak louder than words,” and occurrences like the Tulsa, Okalohoma race riot, the wanton murder of innocent and unoffending negroes, the general policy of oppression and repression and various other forms of injustice meted out to black men and women —and even to childx-en (with whom there certainly should be no quarrel)—furnish eloquent and edifying evidences, of the true nature of Americanism and cannot but be understood alike by aliens here and right-minded persons every, where. It is a curious commentary that white Americans are intensely interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals, but are not, in the slightest degree, concerned about stopping the murder of human beings—when such human beings are black. The whipping of a horse by its driver or the killing of a wild cat occasions an incalculable amount of protests, but the barbarous lynching or black women about to become mothers does not cause any consternation whatever. The case of Mary Turner, who was cfuelly murdered after being indescribably tortured, affords an idea of southern chivalry and southerners' vaunted respect for womanhood. Of course, it must be remembered that the negro is only regarded as a man in times of war, and that, otherwise, he is believed to be just a little more than a dog and quite a great deal less than a man. And at that, there are times without number when the dog is given the benefit of the; doubt. It must also be borne in mind that the negro is the only kind of game which may be hunted with impunity, any day during the year, on the happy hunting grounds or America. The lynching of negroes continues unabated, year after year, because it costs nothing to kill negroes. It is because of this that negroes who are members of the New Manhood Move ment —which is nothing more nor less than a Sinn Fein movement among negroes—have resolved to put a pro- | hibitive price pn lynching. When j white men are made to realize that f negroes are inexorably determined to J kill white men who may attempt to 3 ■ kill them, there will be fewer lynchrj ings. No‘man is so afraid of losing f i his life as that man who would reck i 1 lessly take the life of another. In . vain have negroes prayed and pleadij ed and tried every other peaceable r- means possible. And now, the policy - 1 of retaliation or direct action is the 3 only one which negroes can adopt if > ! self-respect and self-preservation > ■ mean anything < ttf them. Since so far as negroes are concerned, the Constitution of the Unit--5 customs receipts from Hawaii as a ed States, in the opinion of white ’ men and white women, is merely a ’ scrap of paper, a meaningless document, and since the government ac'j quiesces in the wholesale murder of ' its negro citizens and does not afford 1 , them any protection whatever, al- ' though it' spends millions of dollars ’ and employs a veritable army of 1 spies to enforce prohibition and thus ' attempts to regulate the beverages that Americans drink, negroes musi arm themselves and proceed to make good the declaration of the Constitution of the United States as far as it 1 affects their peace, their liberty and ' their happiness. As a natural outgrowth of the at- , titude of the government towards lawlessness of which they are the victims, negroes have developed a state of mind, which, when interpreted, takes this form: That a country which in times of peace cannot or will not protect its citizens at home is unworthy of SSfr patriotism and protection in times of war. . If black men can fight on the battlefields of Europe to protect white men and white women from the Huns of Europe, surely they can fight at least as creditably to protect their mothers, their sisters, their wives and their daughters, their lives and their limbs, their hearts and then homes from the barbarism of the Huns in America. So. and so only, i can negroes secure their fair and s full share 6f those rights and liberties which are not only guaranteed by ; the Constitution of the United States ; of America, but are unquestionably - the common heritage of all mankind.

We don’t deny that the story was important, but we feel that three stories about the same thing is sort of emphasizing .it too much. ! The Advertiser went them one better, however. Sam’l evidently wasn t feeling over-ambitious, as he printed' almost identical editorials in two di -j ferent issues, and the same idea was conveyed in but slightly different wording on a third occasion. It may have been that Sam was impressed with the extreme eloquence dl certain expressions, and could not bear | to have anyone miss seeing the masj terpieces. Or it possibly can be ex- ! plained by the hypothesis that Sam’s lack of ideas and vocabulary forced him to run the same article twice. I ■ * We always like to be constructive, 1 so we offer this gem of thought. In India there dwells and thrives a species of animal known as the chim.l panzee.

Bulletin proclaims to the world that Ambassador J'ohn Hays Hammond donates his bit of cheer for “Hawaii’s cause”. We are in formed in less blazoned heads that the ambassador has offeree? ms sym- : pathy for the coolie bill. ' Then follows a three column book on Mr. Hammond’s declaration to the Bull reporter. We wonder at first what Mr. Hammond could saj)» in all that space, pertaining to the coolie question. After deep scrutiny we find that three lines —just three lines—-out of three columns are devoted to the ■ coolie question. A careful perusal of those three lines develops the interesting point that this lengthy discourse on the coolie bill is entirely equivocal—it can be construed either for or against the bill. Mr. Hammond says that public sentiment is - always right, in such cases. And the Bull plants a great headline to the effect that Ambassador Hammond supports “Ha waii’s bill”! It is barely possible—just barely possible—that \"the rumor of Japanese contributions, and the various other “statements” which are supposed to have been made by people who are not on the' ground to deny, issued from similar sources. The daily disseminators of sugarcoated propaganda are evidently at a loss for new information to fill their columns. For three different issues of the Bull stories were printed all containing the rumor that\" the Japan- How Teddy Looked At It! * # * FIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE—-ROOSEVELT TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES December 5, 1905. “in my judgment immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years 75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Hawaii as a special fund to be expended in the islands for educational and public buildings, and for harbor improve* ments and military and naval defenses. It cannot be too often repeated aim must be to develop the territory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That territory has serious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but no measure of relief can be considered which looks to legislation admitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to field labor and domestic service. The status of servility can never again be tolerated on American soil. We cannot concede that the proper solution to Its prob lems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a class of laborers denit-d admission to the other States and Territories. There are obstacles, and great obstacles, in the way of ing a representative community in the Hawaiian Islands f\"but it is not in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty. Many an American commonwealth has been built up against odds equal to those that now confront Hawaii. No merely half-hearted effort to meet its problems as other Ameri can communities have met theirs can be accepted as final. Hawaii shall never become a territory in which a governing class of/ rich planters exists by means of coolie labor. Ev|i if the rate of growth f>f the Territory is thereby rendered slower, the growth must only take place by the admission of immigfhnts fit m me Communists defeated the trade union bureaucrats in the Metal Workers’ Union of Warsaw, whereupon me bureaucrats ordered another election and thru trickery, won by a narrow margin.

All remit tances to be addressed to the Labor Revievr of Hawaii, Box 543. We’ve got another idea. If these new workers drive the white laborers from the plantation, and remain the only beings here besides the planters, the latter should certainly enjoy themselves. They would be in their element, then. end to assume the duties and burdens of full American citizenship. Our aim must be to develop the Territory on the same basis of stable citizenship as exists on this continent. j 1 *<* v****«****4 u **4 4 *’*****»****** m ** 4 *^***** , *l*4 m **4* 4 ***4 w !**l , 4* | Classroom l ♦♦♦ V ♦ . ♦♦♦ I Teacher | ■i X Unionism Among Teachers An Address by Hon. Jeanette Rankin Representative in Congress from the State of Montana Men and women, it is a great pleasure to meet a union at any time and j it is a special pleasure to meet a| teachers’ union, for we feel that the 1 wolrd is going to move if the teach-' ers will only become organized. Every man and woman in the United States is today thinking very ser-j iously. They are thinking seriously! of this great war and of democracy,! and we can no longer afford to think’ of democracy or to talk of democracy! without living democracy]; and when! we discuss democracy in govern-; ment it should mean something con Crete, it should mean certain steps that we are taking to make it possible for the people to have a voice in their government. We in the West have been thinking about democracy and government for some time and we have worked out certain steps, and each day we realize. more than ever' that democracy is not a real democracy unless it is based upon education. The press is the great educator 01 the masses, and it is on the press that we must depend for a certain amount of education for the masses. It is on the press that we must depend. for the facts o nwhich to base our judgments, and I believe it would rank first among the educators. Bui .through the ballot we have our plublie school system, and unless that public school system teaches the children to know what democracy is and to live democracy, it is going to be very hard for us to make the grown children live democ|acy, and unless the teachers who teach the children know something of democracy, it is going to be hard for them to teach the children, and I believe the teachers’ union is the first step toward teaching the men and women who are teachers in the schools to know what democracy is. . . .j . . . They have had nothing to’ say about what they should teach and: how they should teach it, and until j the teachers realize that they should have something to say about the con ditions under which they work and the way they carry on their work you cannot expect those tecahers to instil in the minds of the children a , real ideal of democracy and make them work for democracy on the outside. So I believe that our teachers’ union is one of the most essential steps, and that it is more essential now that we are talking of democracy that we maye make that ideal that we ‘are fighting for, that some are sacrificing so much for, a real ideal, one that we can live up to, that we may translate that ideal into life, and that if we are doing our part ! -we are going to work for democracy in away that is going to be effective. . . . And when the teachers have learned to express their feelnigs they are going to respect the right of the child to express its feelings, and if the child has gone through a school that is managed as an autocracy it is going to submit to autocracy on the outside, in government and in industry. So I believe that the very first step is for the teachers to make this demand, and it is not possible today for the'teachers to work alone. They must work with other teachers and they must work with all working people, and there is no reason why the teacher should not work with the bricklayer and with the stone mason. (Applause.) The conditions for the teachers are a little better than the conditions for some of' the other workers, simply because teaching is one of the first professions for women to enter outside of the home. Then we have had certain traditions that we'have not lived up to very well,! but still we talk a great deal about! the child and we consider that the child should have a certain amount of care. Of course, it does not go very far but it has gone far enough to make the teacher have a little bet-! ter social position. Yet it does seem to me that the teacher has not had very much respect when we consider the wages that the teacher has received and the tyranny to which most teachers submit, having so little to say about the general management of the schools. Unless wq train the children to want democracy and to live democracy, they are going to be perfectly satisfied with an autocratic government, and they are not going to make; the demand for democracy in indus-j try that is the vital question before 1 the American people today. For we are not anxious for democracy in j government merely for government as j an end in itself, but we want it as a means to secure to all the people greater opportunities, greater protection and greater freedom. Then we must have this democracy govern j ment in order that we may have democracy in industry, and that is the vital question before the Ameri can people today. . . . The Declaration of Independence yesterday meant self-government , Today it means self-employment. And we will hav edemocracy in industry-, it will come just as quietly and much more swiftly than the democracy in government which we. have achieved. And all this that we may have democracy in social life; and we will have democracy in social life when we have equal opportunity and equal protection and equal freedom, and the more nearly we approach equality in social life the more rapidly will we reach the time when we will evolve a race with the capacity for happiness and surrounded by the instrumentalities for enjoying life. Then e can feel, as well as say, not only, “I am as good as you are, but you are as good as I am.” I thank you.

Men of thought have always opposed such outrage; but again another instance of this barbarous act has been reported from Alabama. The negro has almost invariably been the victim of lynching and again it is he. The negro was hanged in Alabama for killing a white < Intel. To punish a murderer, there is the police for apprehending the man and the court of justice for trial. After sufficient evidence has been found, justice could be meted out by sending the criminal to the gallows. This procedure is the institution of modern civilized countries. . Ignoring the law, the citizens of Birmingham, Alabama, caught the negro suspected of murdering the white child, and, instead of turning him over to the police or giving him a fair trial, swung him up to a tree. The younger brother and sister (both not more than 10 years old) of the boy who was killed were with their father to witness the hanging. The sick mother sent word that she is sorry she can’t be at the execution. We Japanese think it is terrible enough to bring children not yet ten years old to a hanging. But these Alabamans yelled and screamed at the negro three feet away from him and when he ceased to breathe they scrambled for bits of the rope used for the hanging. Such action is not human. It is the act of a blood-thirsty demon. If this outrage had been enacted in Borneo or the wilds of Africa, it is not worth discussion, But when it took place in a first-power, Christian country, which pride* in its civilization, in broad daylight, wc cannot help but entertain a doubt of its culture. Happily, lynching has never taken place in Hawaii. But seeing the numerous cases of lynching in the states we realize that Americans arc brutal and non-law-abid-ing. Educated people in America are strongly opposed to lynching. Those who engage in this act are mostly ignorant. But many educated persons in America think taking the law into their hands justifiable because of the laxity of the pojice and court. As long as people who have this erroneous conception exist, it is difficult to extirpate the evil from America. The citizens of Birmingham ale not only disgracing the entire nation hut also leaving an indelible impression of brutality and lawlessness on the minds of their children. This is a point that requires serious introspection by Americans. * Spirit of Service Rev. S. Sokabe, who has worked with industry for the last 25 years in educating young citizens in his private school in Honomu, Hawaii, has already received public contribution amounting to $6OOO for the reconstruction of his school house. But $9OOO is the estimated tost and he still lacks $3OOO. Reverend Sokabe has decided that he will no longer depend on public charity. He will publish his new book, “The Last Three Thousand” and complete his school from CHOLERA CASES FOUND AT KOBE (Spiclol Sadia l* The Nlppu Ji|l) TOftYO. Aug. 19—Cholera cases have bceen reported in Kobe. Public health authorities are taking precautionary steps to check the spreading thfc disease. the funds gained from selling this book. The title of the book is something unusual. But we admire the character of this saintly figure of Honomu. We are moved by his ' sincerity and open-hearteclness. The life of Reverend Sokabe has been one of devotion. Forsaking all search for fame or wealth he has devoted his life to the ministry with untiring effort. The greatness of the man is shown here. Regardless of whether we know 1 him or not, we should like to see ! the Japanese help “the saint of Honomu” whole-heartedly. NO MORE HOIIS FOR WAIKIKI AREA Tl»e land cast of Maker road at Waikiki, including the beach property across from Kapiolani park, will not be included in the district to be designated as the hotel and apartment house section as an amendment to the building ordinances. The bill alter passing the first reading, and alter been given a public hearing was referred to the city attorney lor redralting at the meeting ol the supervisors held yesterday. Oppositions were made by various parties, W. A. White ol the Pacific Trust Company claiming that the land already sold by the company in the Diamond Head district was sold with the restriction that no hotels, taverns, stares, or tenements were to be erected on the grounds. The Outdoor Circle also opposed, stressing on the fact that the beach property across from Kapiolani park was desired as an addition to the park.

JamerCswpbdl, a notable-figure in Hawaii during the past century, ran away from his home hi Ireland in 1839 and came to 4 ■’America. From New Bedford, Mass., he took passage on a whaling vessel bound for the Pacific around the Horn. The ship was wrecked ip the South Seas. Campbell’s life was saved by a floating spar which enabled him to reach an island. Cannibals captured him and would probably have made a meal of him, but he again saved his life by repairing an old flintlock musket in the possession of the chief. The chief ordered him set free and he was adopted by the tribe. He escaped to Tahiti a few months later on a passing ship which was putting into the island for fresh supplies. In Tahiti he assisted the natives in a rebellion against the French and finally left for Hawaii on a whaler which landed him at Lahaina, Maui. He accumulated some capital by building and repairing houses and ships, and with this started a sugar plantation at Lahaina in 1861. Success came through hard work and in the 7o’s he founded the Pioneer Mill at Lahaina which today is one of the main plantations of the Islands. In 1879 Mr. Campbell bored the first flowing well of artesian water in Hawaii at Ewa, Oahu. This well, is still flowing. ——* •--+ — ; \\ ■ .

For some time he engaged in the book-publishing business in the East, but gave this up and left for California m the historic gold rush of 1849. With his earnings in the gold fields of Yuba Dam and Feather River he established a successful trad* ing and provision business and became prominent in California’s early history. While returning from a visit to his parents in Norway in 1853, Mr. Knudsen contracted “Panama fever” and the doctor ordered him to a warm, dry climate. Largely by chance he landed at Koloa, Kauai, from a sailing vessel, and there learned that his fortune was lost through duplicity of business associates in California. < He started his career in Hawaii from the bottom, and through his own efforts built up a large industry. He devoted his attention to sugar production and became manager of Grove Farm Plantation, later purchasing and developing land, at Kekaha and Mana which today form several of the most productive plantations in the Islands.

Soon alter Ishii’s return to this country ' gave out the following impression on the question relatr mg to mandated territories now under the supervision of the League: ' Germany wants her former colonics and i openly saving so. There is alreaci, an association with the retrieval of these lands at its ultimate object Although there 1 considerable opposition todr y in the League against returning these mandated territories to their former owners, I believe It will have to aerr-de to Germany’s demands in part at least pretty , soon. \"Some reports even show that the. territories were’better administrated b the Germans before the n at pre>en under ch ■ League’s mandate. Easing its claims on such facts Germany has every r.ght to make :uch demand. . ail the more, because .ha has been recently not only included in the League but elected a member of the Council. I suppose Germans will ask for , their former colonies in Africa, and I do not believe that they would ask for the return of the Caroline L.lands, these being too far away and more a burden than i a boon to Germany today. I do not think that Fmnce would make any strong stand against the above demands from , her fdrmer foe. lor rodav the feel- . mg between France and Germany . is becoming much better than It red in both countries is gradually ; disappearing, and those who believe in Franco-German amity are today publicly voicing it. a thing which could not have happened \"It is the 'necessity being felt now in both countries, which demands for union between Germany and France to bring them back the prosperity they lost In the Grea: war Firmly established \"The League is today firmly established. and in spite of small rifts which may happen occasionally I do not believe that it will ever end »n disaster. I have the utmost laith In that organization and I will use everything in my pow r’t succe i and brill liance\" he concluded. 纏活鹽水發賣 II 食檄硏究家小 ！11 丑太郞氏が拾有餘年問も魂も財產も全部 ^ 込んで發見せられたる菡劑活搛水は眞に -111: 界的一大發兑ビして今や故國の上下を擧げて篇異的歡迎を受けつ 1 のり 、 旣に九十餘種の病患を ^ 治したる此遥劑を任來同胞諸 ^ に提供する機钤を得たるは弊商曾の最も光榮ビする所なり 、 されど故國の沿川货大にして三ヶ所製鹽所の供給を以てしても尙不足を ^ げ從て海外への輸出僅少なるため普く全米國の藥店にて ^ 捌く事を得ざるは大に追憾ビする處にして地方不便の御方は下記郵税を添へ直接御註文を乞ふ ( 婦女界五六 、 七 、 八 、 九 、 十一月號を御參照ぁれ ) ―’ 11 —' ー ^ ！ 、 ^ 四登犯 ー 區一 〇 仙第五區三ん仙 11# ー ¥11 | ぬ || 。 ；：： だ “ 一 . ,，，:.. , ！：： しト 1 ィ , 旣に實驗して仓治したる病名の一部實に左の如し ， 病肱カタル以人病月絰不肋 ， 一コチン中逛便 1. 於 ^^ ツヮ 9 衍醉肋間神耔痛喘思ニキビヒビソバカスリコ ， チス惑 1-1 乳不足靜胆 .^ 萏 0 症肺尖カタル心狱耳だれコレラ亦 ，0 れ多祐風强溢血打蛄病 ， 乳相 ^ 0 疔子 ?; 内膜炎这 & 边乐疝痛洩れ眼トラネ ー ム桑沿ジヤクソン ^ ニ三八 ^ 热ドグラス一二一六 ， ； 】 コ 11 味噌 . 桃製造所滔藤本商會 NUMBER 10031 8"

Furthermore, in spite of the hard times now prevailing, bars and cafes are prospering, which is a most undesirable state of affairs, considering the necessity of economy. Unless the people maintain a community conscience, no theory of political economy or social reforms, however finely-spun, can avail. A party of two hundred .American students are coming on a visit to this country in the summer of this year. The party has been organized by Professor Joseph Washington Fall, who holds a chair in the Oriental Department of the University of Washington, and who is an authority on Eastern affairs. The party consists of students of many universities throughout America, and when the plan was announced applications greatly exceeded expectations. It looks as .though Washington has temporarily been moved to Havana. A JOKE A couple of kids were playing in a church yard, one white the other black. A Catholic priest was coming along, whereupon the American kid, greeted “Good morning, ’ ather.” “Good morning boys” was the priest’s response. “Say, Bob dat aint yer fahdah, am he ?” “ I know he aint,” said Bob, “ he is only the priest of our church, and we call him Father.” Next morning while Sam was playing in the same yard, the same priest passed by. Catching sight of him, Sam greeted him:—“Goo* mohnin’ Fahdah.” Pleased with this, the priest responded “ Why, good morning, young man. Are you a Catholic ?*’ io which Sam । blurted out“ Hell no 1 Bad enough to be a nigger, aint it ?” the Japanese News ruiDAY 17. rebruaru i92« ADVICE TO AMERICA The new naval expansion proposal is unpopular throughout the world except, perhaps, at Home. The reason for its unpopularity is of course fear. Some of our naval experts publish pessimistic views to the effect that if the new American plan be realised, and Japan adheres to the status quo, there will be no possibility of victory for Japan in the improbable event of war. Well, the promoters of the American plan may be pleased to hear this, because “Victory Without Battles”—mailed fist in other words—is said to be their true intent. However this may be, there is one point which the American people ought never to forget, and that is the importance of spirit as a necessary concomitant of fighting force. Although we are not absolutely sure of their truth, we received reports at the time of the American Squadrons* demonstration visit to our shores several years ago, that not a few of the Yankee bluejackets fearing eventual war with Japan, deserted their ships at every port where a stop was made. Hence the squadron was called “a colonisation squadron.” We believe that the reports were greatly enaggerated. but they are none the less a good reminder to the American Naval authorities. Because we sincerely hope that the slogan of “Victory Without Battle” will be realised to the benefit of all nations concerned, we do wish that the American Navy will be strengthened not only by the tonnage and number of vessels and guns, but also by the heroic valour of the men as well.—O.M. Along wi'h outlawing of offensive war, we must also prohibit “aggressive 1 peace” which brings about defensive ’ war. ~/r\\ MB * i II 寺から風へ気城器ずら竇れて異擧健敏卧からった工對常吁傲嚇のまピト 1 靄に星で , ぬとあって客臘除欲の一ソ鐘を確胎に脈岡を下り I た 、 そして別の帆の心 : さな秘をに ％ ったが , — 一鐘を则くたび 、 山腰を即るたび 、 子供たちが寺へ ・ らう ・ くといふので賑ってゐる △ 不動樣に相談際鬣でパタ ； やられた雪教郡協黯の峭あり 、 1^ 颱ヘョシ ；I 3 を融はし 、 勘型ほ目羯できめるが 、 その黑欄 / は声 ^. 曲と鼻の一部をのこして瞿白胡 11(1 気副 - < . 確 % 子 ( アサム \" ジャワ ) 0 - ニ = ー 生総金 (\" 二エ ) ミ ー ー ー 兵 A 其他ブッチャン ー 0 会 X 麺耻一封度 ！ ー ・ 0 パタ 7 濃洲氷以一封度虎 01 髪生 . ハタ ー 同直交一 0 , メ 、 マク対大十本 ?

Move Is Sponsored In Nippon to Have Governors Elected Bclyukal leaders are again considering the plan of popular election of prcfectural governors, a subject which comes up for public dlscuelon whenever a new Ministry In Japan carries out a wholesale dismissal of those governors who arc considered opponents to the party In power. The question of making the office of a prcfectural governor an elective office Instead of on appointment from the Central Government, was first considered by Selyukal members several years ago, when the old Kakushln Club, then headed by Tsuyoshl Inukal, amalgamated with the Selyukal.

Sept. 6—The question of the precise cause of Joe Rokumoto’s death after Mrs. Alexander Pontages* automobile had In- ' Jurcd him kept Dr. Frank R. Webb on the stand for several hours during today’s session of her trial for second degree murder. Dr. Webb, assistant county autopsy surgeon, flatly answered; Death was due to shock following fracture of the pelvis and dislocation of the thigh bone and the surgical proceeduro of reduction. Contributory factor being a tubercular abscess. Around that statement there was flung a draping of uncertainly through the questioning of defense counsel. DEFENSE THEORY Max Stoucr. conducting the Pantages cross-examination of Dr. Webb, dealt with every single item of Dr Webb’s autopsy report, and particularly with the defense theory of whether or not the operation itself might have been the cause of j the man s death. It will be a defense contention that Rokurnoto would probably not have died had ho not been placed under anaesthetic. Steuer, victor of many famous legal battles In New York, seemed to have the prosecution worried as he demonstrated his medical knowledge. JONES SCORE Yet District Attorney Harold Jones did himself proud In his redirect questions of Webb. Young Jones—barely a youth—drew the sting from much of Steuer’s work. \"Isn't it true that tho operation was necessary to save Rokumoto's life?\" he asked. \"In my opinion It was,\" replied Dr. Webb. \"Isn’t It true that neglect to operate to reduce his Injuries would have resulted In at least very serious complications?\" \"Yes.** Late In the afternoon court adjourned to the scene of the fatal automobile crash In Hollywood.

SAC’TO BOVS GIVE TALKS ABOUTJAPAN SACRAMENTO WEEK BY WEEK Troop 25 Gets Warm, elcome in Japan Says Murray n* \\ SACRAMESTAV •• *>• AirM I Their heart* overflowing with JO7 of coming bai to the arms of their parent* and :o the beautiful city of Sacramento, thirty-eight Boy Scouts of the Troop 25 told frankly their Impressions of Japan and Japanese las: Friday evening at the American Center Churqh. A Portuguese. Leo Nordest, was Included among the boy. of the Troop 25 which made an extensive •our of Japan :hl. summer and which returned to their homeland Just recently. GREETED CHEERFULLY ' I could not put in any way to expre my feelings, but I know this much that I shall never forget the cheerful smiles with which the Japanese people greeted us everywhere we went during our trip there” said 13-year-old scout Nordest. Every one seemed to have suffered plenty with mosquitoes and bedbug biles, and with sleeping on flat \"tataml.\" They stated frankly how they were tired In seeing temples and shrines wherever they visited, but one scout Yoshlo Kamikawa said that if they knew history they would have enjoyed them greatly and would have profited thereby. ALL GENTLEMEN* Scoutmaster Geo. F. Murray gave a detailed report of the trip in which he said. During the seventeen days each way crossing the Pacific, and forty day* on the Great Empire of Japan, not one boy in the troop behaved that would have brought disgrace upon him and upon our troop.\" All in all. it was a grand moment la the lives of these scouts, and the trip was successful. How abundant the fruit* the trip will bear In the future no one knows, but the writer felt that It would have brought a greater fruits if the tour was postponed until all the boys had reached the later hlgh-school age when they could grasp the significance of all the things they saw and heard and did in Japan. ENGAGED Clarence Ryulchl Tsukano of this city is engaged to Miss Elsie Klyonu Yokoyama of Honolulu It was announced recently which was quite * a surprise to younger circles of Sacramento. They will marry some time this month or in the early pan of next month. Miss Yokoyama has come to the mainland last July from Honolulu, She Is a graduate of McKinley high school. Tsukano Is being employed at the Hayashl Dental works as a condensite technician. This writer sighed deeply when the announcement was delivered to him. Seems like he Is gradually being left alone. COMINGS AND GOINGS Walter Tsukamoto Is coming to Sacramento to open up his law office here, it was made definite recently. Miss Lily Oyama left for Los Angeles las: Friday to enter an art school there. Henry Ichimura. former Sacramentan and a U. C. student, is la town spending his week-end. John \"Smoky\" Kuwamoto is attending the Junior College after his return from Japan as a member of the Troop 25, who acted as the official photographer of the troop.

Even a s’mple rumour, on the other hand, of a negro having perpetrated a slight insult against a white woman will arouse the entire community into a frenzy of rage, indeed turn it into a mob. About few days ago the population of Sherman City, Texas, were suddenly seized by murderous impulse when a rumour of a negro’s having been arrested on the charge of committing indecency against a white woman was broadcast. A huge crowd stormed the court house where the negro had been taken and set it afire. The negro died in the flames, but his body was dug from the ruins and after being dragged through the town, was hanged on a tree in the negro quarter. Several days later, on May 17, in the town of Honeygrove, Texas, another brutal deed was committed by a maddened mob upon the body of a negro who was shot dead by a sheriff on the charge of having fired at a white man. “ The mob fastened the dead negro to the rear of a truck,” the report said, “ and dragged it two miles until they reached the front of a negro church, where they suspended the body on a tree and burned it with gasoline.” * Men, women and children,\" one of : the reports stated, “ clapped their hands 老後の計 \\ 気露 II 代富江畑洋行ニ ： ー ニ ー ニ ー"

WILL all the Japanese Christian churches of various denominations finally unite Into one organisation? Yesterday’s paper brings us the news that represdntatlvcs of the Japanese Congregational churches ln California, meeting In Oakland for their annual conference, passed a resolution advocating the unification of all the Japanese churches on the coast. Not only did they pass a resolution, but ns the first actual step, they have decided to approach t h e Presbyterian churches with their proportion. To an outsider, all tills fuss seems like making a mountain out of a mole hill. Considered from every angle, union of the churches seems such an obviously logical thing that we can only wonder why It has not been brought about long ago. It should have been accomplished with : little fuss and excitement. But evl- ' denlly, historic differences of long standing, especially In matters of I religion, are hard to overcome, and much time and earnest effort have been necessary to bring church union even up to the point where it Is j now. JAPANESE young people on the Pacific coast can only rejoice that these steps toward church union, even though slow, are taking place. We hope that they will be speeded up. What docs youth care about the niceties of theological differences which were hatched by cloistered monks of medieval times, or differences of church polity bred by the American Civil war I Why should ancient differences which have so Utile hearing on present conditions divide the forces of the church! In the present world of rampant materialism, why should the forces that stand for spiritual richness dissipate their efforts by remaining divided I In looking over the activities of the various Christian denominations working among the Japanese on the Pacific coast, one can note a long record of needless duplication of effort. of competition for territory, of over-lapping activities. As a matter of strict business efficiency, It would seem that church union 1c called for. And has not the community the right to ask that agencies working for the spiritual welfare of the community conduct their activities In os efficient a manner as possible? The matter of church union Is one which concerns not only the Christians. Whether one Is a Christian or a Buddhist or an advocate CITIZENS IN HAWAII END STHCONFAB Education and Crime, Dual Citizenship, Discussed (Spiel.) to J.panel. American New.) HONOLULU, July 16—The Jlfth annual conference of the American citizens of the Japanese parentage, who have been meeting here since Monday to discuss various problems Intimately connected with them, came to a successful close today at the Y.W.C.A. building. More than 50 prominent Japanese citizens from the eight mala Islands In the territory were In attendance. PROBLEMS CONSIDERED Among the many weighty problems that came up before the body for consideration during the past week were: the \"problem of ’useful’ education and crime; party affiliations, precinct club activities, etc; i Themes dealing with customs, manners. and ethics of Japan, and the advisability of their adoption by the local young people; Industrial prospects for the second generation Japanese; and problems of dual ditl- , zenshlp.\" I The speakers during the confer- | cnc Included such well known char- ' ucters as Governor Lawrence M. Judd, Stcrelary Raymond C. Brown, Mayor George Fred Wright, Consul General Yoshlo Iwate, President i David L. Crawford of the University of Hawaii, Congressional Dele- ' gate Victor S. K. Houston, and Prank C. Atherton, president of Castle and Cooke company. VERSATILE MEETING The conference this year was made more versatile and is expected to have a far-reaching Influence In view of the fact that It was representative of young men from wide varieties of occupation such as public school teachers, farmers, salesmen, storekeepers, office clerk, dental hygienists, realtors, chemists, painters, social workers, building contractors and newspapermen. Besides conducting discussions on the various problems, the delegates to the gathering were entertained with everol socials In the afternoons and evenings during the duration of the conference. of no religion at all. one cannot help but be Interested In seeing that the forces that are working for the spiritual welfare of the community, regardless of affiliations, conduct their activities In keeping with the demands of the times. We therefore congratulate the Congregational conference for the step they have taken and sincerely hope that the churches will speedily go much further In this right direction.

I This Is the first time that the 1 school Is being held In the bay logon. the sessions during the past five years having been held in Mon- , terey. i In view of the fact that It will be centrally located In relation to many outlying Japanese communities, the school Is expected to draw a large crowd this year. The first two days of the school will be held at the Japanese M. E I church on Pine street and the remalner of the session is scheduled to be Weld at the Japanese Church of Christ at Post and Octavla streets. The Rev. Mr. Olsht of the Walnut Grove Japanese M. E. church, south, will be the superintendent of the summer school and will have the following workers assisting him; the Rev. Mr. Inorl, pastor: the Rev. Mr Oda, business manager; the Rev. Mr. Aiura .treasurer ;the Rev. Mr, Kowta, director of the young people’s department: and Miss Sumlle Morlshlta, director of the younger group. SILKTRADE ON UPGRADE \"The seasonal improvement of foreign trade Is exepeted to start during August, and will probably continue throughout the fall and winter months, reaching a ful fledged business uptrend during the spring of 1932.\" This was the prediction today of Henry Farmer, assistant collector of customs In charge of the local office at present. The Japanese counsular offices in New York also Is looking for a revival of trade on the Pacific according to a pamphlet Just Issued by the consulate.. Supporting the contention of Increasing business are customs collection figures here for the first fifteen days of July, totaling $721,065. Collections for each of the first six months of the year were under the million dollar mark. That figure will be greatly exceeded during July. Another indication of future business Is seen in the announcement of the Silk Association of America that 1 fifteen transpacific ships will bring silk cargoes here during August, the largest number of the year.

INSPIRING BOOK On this question Mr. Jotaro Ya- j mamoto. former President of the j South Manchuria Railway, has written a most illuminating and inspiring book, showing how it is possible I for Japan to become a great Indus- 1 trial nation. Consider iron for one. The mines for which Japan has * concession in Manchuria contain. * according to Mr. Yamamoto, at least - 1.300,000.000 tons. While Preslent of the South Manchuria Railway .a few years ago Mr. Yamamoto formulated a plan ’ ( whereby iron could eventually be e j obtained from those mines at less than 20 yen at a ton. At present ' i the annual output is only 200,000 tons, but Mr. Yamamoto is confident that the day will come when Japan ’ will no longer rely upon American or 3 European mills for iron or steel As for the coal necessary for the iron ' industry, the famous Pushun mines whose deposits is estimated at one ■ billon ton, are close at hand to sup- * ply it. < OIL PROBLEM f • Incidentally, the nitrogen, ob- . talned in converting the coal into v coke, can be utilized. If Mr. Yarna--0 moto’a plan is followed, to proa duce yearly at least 300,000 tons of - ammonium sulphate, an Invaluable [. fertilizer, which will Increase Jat pan’s annual output of rice by - 15,000,000 bushels. What Is more Im--1 portant. Mr. Yamamoto offers a s solution for Japan’s oil problem s which has long been considered Insoluble. When he resigned from the South Manchuria Railway he had left a plant already established for an initial yearly production of 76000 tons of shale oil from the Pushun coal mines. If this experiment proves a success the enterprise will [ eventually be so extended as to do away with all oil Importations now amounting to 1,700,000 tons a year. Moreover, the lowest stratum of the Pushun coal mines consists of a certain kind of cool which can be converted into liquid coal at small cost. In addition Mr. Yamamoto assures us that before long the process of hydrogenation will be so improved that any kind of coal mined from the practically Inexhausllle Pushun mines cart be utilized for that purpose. UNDER PRODUCTION As Mr. Yamamoto sees It, Japan’s problem is not overproduction but underproduction. Her Imports exceed her exports by 1100,000,000 • almost almost every year. Mr Ya- { mamoto thinks it quite practicable i to reverse this trade balance in Japan’s favor, if only the statesmen J and the industrialists at the helm are far-seeing enough and courageous enough to launch and execute 1 a great programme of industrial 1 readjustment. Japan’s total imports according ; to Mr. Yamamoto, amount to 2,500,000,000 yen a year. Of this sum only one-half is the cost of material, the other half representing the labor which goes into the making of , those imports, chief of which are , steel, machinery, oil automobiles, and fertilizers. If we produced these , ployment to our own men whose i wages would amount to 1.250,000.000 , yen a year. At present our factory , population numbers 2,070.000, producing 7,155,000,000 yen worth of ; goods. Add to this non-factory Industrlal laborers (exclusive of fari merst and the number is 18.860,000. i In Mr. Yamamoto's opinion, wo could give employment to another 15,000,000, if we made in our own factories the goods we now import. The programme of Industrialization, as conceived by Mr. Yamamoto, calls ’ for an initial outlay of some 1.200,000,000 yen for the purchase of the | necessary machinery and the building mills, refineries, factories, etc., that is. If It Is to be executed into at once. But we need not start on so ambitious a scale, we can divide the programme into section, to be carried out one after another. In developing Manchuria's natural resources Japan Is actuated by motives of self-preservation. At ‘ the same time, however, she does not forget China’s welfare, and prosperity. Her motto Is Kyoson kyoyel (mutual existence and mu- ; tual prosperity) signifying that Ja- ‘ ] pan alms to promote China’s pros- ’ perlty as muc has her own. In the end China will be greater gainer, be- ’ cause whatever new enterprise may ‘ be launched In Manchuria by the Japanese will give employment to the natives, with whom the Japanese ; workers do not care to compete, add ’ to the wealth and development of [ the territory, and attract thither immigrants from the fa--1 mine-ridden, war-tom, bandlt-ln--1 Tested provinces south of the Great Wall. As a matter of fact, these immigrants have been pouring into Manchuria by the million during - the last several years solely because n Japan has maintained there peace s and created prosperity such as Is 0 j found In no other parts of China.

PERIOD OF TRANSITION Of late the active work on the Japanese farms has been shifting into the hands of nisei farmers. The present period mav be looked upon as an important one in the history of Japanos? in America, for it i%a period of transition in which the nisei are coming into their own. Under the joint sponsorship of the Japanese farmers’ organizations, an oratorical contest will be held soon for the purpose of stimulating nisei interest in th* importance of farming and the role the second generation Japanese are expected to play in the near future. 40 MILLION DOLLARS According to recent statistics, Japanese farmers in southern l California produce fruits and veI getables annually valued at over forty million dollars. Of this amount twenty-five million doli lars are transactions within the state while fifteen million is in inter-state trade. The Japanese first generation pioneers to America worked - without benefit of assistance f from the American people. They ; labored under severe handicaps. » Little consideration did they ref ceive. They were discriminated i against by the alien land law. - The path of their progress was ft impeded by language barriers. ; But in spite of all, they gradu3 1 ally succeeded. And soon they r were cultivating thousands of » acres in Southern California. > Do the Nisei have the confi- * dence and spirit u> carry on th« work of the issei? NISEI ARE CITIZENS * Though handicapped still, the « Nisei are much better off than * the issei were. With dtixensrfip : rights, the Nisei are In a position , to demand what they are legally * entitled to. The Nisei speak the American language with little j difficulty. Thus I feel that if the nisei would turn their mind to the farming Industry, a most brilliant future is awaiting them. There are various other fields for the Nisei to explore.

They find traveling in the United States very disagreeable to them, largely on account of the discrimination and the humiliation they receive.

[ j ‘Lines and Outlines' CUT BY ROY KAWAMOTO WORDS BY DAIROKt SUGAHARA JROne of the select Japan has long been looked up to as the only hope of the colored people. She has, so far, been the only one who could match wits with the best of the white races. And no doubt the Nipponese treatment of the socalled inferior peoples has always been fair. But it makes one wonder whether or not the Negroes, though they are heartily welcomed, might not find it discomforting to travel in Nippon. True, people of file colored races have gone to Nippon, but not in so great a nunroer, and that is what makes facts alarming. Such a group is a rare sight and the Japanese are not bound to miss it. The results are self-explana-tory. SCOTTSBORO CASE Now speaking of discrimination of the Negro, it brings us back today to the topic of the famous Scottsboro case, which, incidentally, found itself once again on the front pages of our newspapers this past week. Readers will remember that on March 25, 1931, that nine Negroes were jailed on charges of attacking Mrs. Victoria Price and Ruby Bates, white women aboard a freight train. The girls were tramps. Two Negroes were indicted and sentenced to death, but after three and a half years of trying the case the United States Supreme Court finally stepped in and decided to help the Negro tramps out. They reversed the indictmenL The truth of the whole matter to that the Negro to not wellliked In this country. The mania to lynch a Negro flames In every white man’s eye, It seems, the minute he hears that a white girl has been “attacked\". And that mania to more deep-rqpted than print. In the Scottsboro case, the girls later denied the Negroes had attacked them and later they were not even able to Identify the accused, but that made no difference The Southern courts argued that by denying the charges the girls could have lied In their retraction aa they bed in falsely accusing the Negro tramps The whole thing, then, revolves In the fact that the South »a determined not to give the Negro justice. And worse stlH a young Jew had come down to defend the colored hoboes, which made matters tremendously important since the Jew Is as much hated aa the Negro.

The regret is that only a short time is being devoted to the various problems that should receive the serious consideration of those present. The English sections are assuming a heavy responsibility because they are the leading medium whereby second generation opinion is being molded. Also, the American public is judging us through what appears in the columns. Such being the case, the Nisei journalists are not as free in their writings as they want to be. It is those who do not exercise discretion that spread out in black and white everything that happens. At times, censorship through gen- I tlemen’s understanding has been hecessa.ry in order to protect the general welfare. We believe that among the many business to be discussed, i the press conference should make clear to the public the ethics of a newspaperman. Most people are afraid to talk in the presence of reporters for fear they will be quoted. The statement, “He is a newspaperman so look out,” is commonly heard. In this connection, we recall the dinner we had with Mr. John Thompson of the “International Parade” column. He stated that he has talked with diplomats and leaders of various nations; that they have confided and discusse many confidential matters, that he has earned the reputation of being trustworthy and therefore all who speak to him do not hesitate to express their candid opinions. In the days gone by, some of j the first generation reporters were scandal mongers and I blackmailers. They used to re-1 ceive anonymous letters injurious to the reputation of some of the leaders of the community. In order to keep such news out of the papers, the individual would be contacted and would be compelled to pay money. These evil practices no longer exist. Furthermore, the Nisei journalists have established a very good reputation for keep- ! ing the confidence of leaders. They have cooperated and thus have enabled important work to be kept under cover until fully i planned out. It is important that publicity be given regard- 1 ing the code of ethics in order ! that the newspapers may be | consulted in advance by all the ! second generation, as individuals and as representatives of organizations before they launch important projects. Although trivial, the matter of “scoops” should be discussed. Too great an emphasis seems to be placed on the value of “printing first,” This is an admirable spirit; but if carried to excess; becomes an absurdity. The press should try to outline methods whereby news of public interest emanating from organizations can be handled for all concerned. Some years ago, the papers of this city had an arrangement whereby one paper would be responsible for news for a few months and then the other and in this manner alternate. In this manner, news received were relayed to the others by the one in charge. The revival of such a system may do away with the present unnecessary rivalry and hard feelings, because the other may have obtained a “scoop.” An ennunciation of the policies of the newspapers towards second generation problems may be helpful. There are many other ways in which the press conference can be of value. It all depends upon those who participate. Just as the public is expecting a great deal from the national convention, they also Agree to Hold Exchange Meets Oriental Students to Visit Yosemite In Groups In a significant move toward understanding between Japanese and Chinese students, a group of these Oriental students who attended the Pacific Area conference held last week at Mills College in Oakland, will visit Yosemite together leaving Oakland Wednesday morning. I An agreement is reported to I have been reached by Japanese | and Chinese students to hold j exchange student conferences in Japan and China in the future. “We have had some conflicts in our views at the beginning, of the conference,” Toshio Kanchi, a Japanese student delegate, said yesterday. “But we held two private conferences of our own aside from the conference proper - and came to have better outlooks on each other regarding many Oriental problems facing our country and China. “We are extremely happy that this Mills conference had furnished us this opportunity to bring Japanese and Chinese stu- ! dents to closer friendship, and I sympathetic appreciation of I each other’s problems.” Holland Girl Is Seriously Hurt Kazuko Iseri, 4, Falls Out of House Window SACRAMENTO, Sept. 1 —Ka- , zuko Iseri, 4-year-old daughter of Yoshio Iseri, a Holland Tract farmer, is hovering between life and death line today at the Sutter Hospital—and she is fight- ! ing against death bravely, acI cording to attending physicians. ) Kazuko fell from a window 111:30 o’clock yesterday afternoon | while playing in her home, and j received serious injuries about her head.

CALLS PEACE PARLEY Japan’s Interest in Meet Both Econoic, Political By HUGH BYAS TOKYO, Sept. 1 —Answering, gesture with gesture, officials, after a study of the New York Times article dealing with President Roosevelt’s consideration of a new peace conference, indicated that Japan would not refuse an invitation to participate in a world conference seeking to remove the menace of peace. Their responses were welcomed i|h many quarters as an indication that Japan is willing to resume, at least partially, the international cooperation she broke off at Geneva in 1933. Japan’s policy at such a peace conference would be both political and industrial. Politically, Tokyo would aim. at regional understandings dividing the world into areas in which leading powers would assume strictly local responsibility for maintaining peace. The immediate practical purpose of this policy would be to obtain the world’s acknowledgement of Japan’s preponderant position in East Asia, As a matter of form, Japan is willing to associate China with herself in such a task, China’s role, proportioned to her power, to be that of a very junior partner. Russia, from the Japanese standpoint, could contribute to Far Eastern peace at the present moment reducing her army in Siberia as the first step* The second step would require a clear demarcation in RussoJapanese interests in China’s vast Mongolian hinterland. But although a deal with Russia is essential to Far Eastern peace, the Japanese do not yet see how a world conference could assist in a transaction solely concerning Russia and Japan, with China as a nervous onlooker. Besides seeking the desired acknowledgement of her Far East position Japan would raise foreign trade questions, including the free opening of markets, access to raw materials and the right of colonization. Far-seeing Japanese realize that question of raw materials and colonization would quickly be sidetracked by those of tariffs and quotas. The fact that Japan has built up a huge export trade on imported cotton is evidence that she already enjoys access to raw materials. Japan is notoriously deficient, in oil, yet gasoline sells at every filling station here for 16 cents a gallon. The real question is not the lack of raw materials, but the attitude of industrial nations with high standard of living toward the products of Japan’s comparably cheap labor. The point about colonization cannot be raised seriously, since in Manchoukuo, a fertile country twice as large as Germany, Japan has access to a virgin territory capable of accommodating millions of settlers.

The trip through Manchoukuo was most interesting and, since the weather chose to be California-like in being ‘unusual,’ we had pleasantly cool weather all the time we were there. This was quite contrary both to our own expectations and those of our escort.” Miss Elizabeth Hambagar of Stockton returned by an earlier steamer due to sudden illness.

He is a Republican in his political belief. On those days when Mr. Kido is unable to write the column our staff writers pinch hit to fill the space. A STORY The inconsistent opinions expressed in these columns once in a while may have been puzzling to our readers. For instance, out of a clear sky, an article appeared in October in the midst of the presidential campaign, criticizing the Republicans. The staff members of the other paper had tq wager as to the authorship and have us verify in order to decide the winner. We wouldn’t be a bit surprised if they had thought that some money may have been passed to sway the writer of this column. At least, they were wondering what had happened. The truth was that the brilliant Democrat, Eddie Shimano substituted and wrote it. Then yesterday, the writer again was not abe to perform his duties. The result was the second inconsistent article. This time, Editor Howard Imazeki, Tomomasa Yamasaki and Eddie Shimano, all of the same political belief, wrote three separate Items. The regular writer of this column has not been on the job regularly. But he recalls the days when Tosuke Yamasaki was the feature writer on this publication. He substituted very frequently but he at least respected the announced opinions of the writer. This paper has given the writers free rein in stating their opinions and so this extend even to the point of making a column appear inconsistent. If the editor gives such an attitude, the staff cannot bdmplain. At least this writer has none.

THE NEW WORLD-SUN ADVISERS GET THE BEST RESULTS. U.C. Student Grid Eleven to Battle Eastbay Stars as Decided Underdog BERKELEY, Nov. 6—The 1936, edition of the University of California JSC gridiron gallopers will make its initial appearance against a Japanese opponent on i Nov. 15 when it clashes with + he Eastbay All-Star aggregation in what should be the gridiron classic of Northern California. 1 Coach Tom Sasaki’s Bear bat- | tiers will enter the game as decided underdogs against the much heavier and experienced Eastbay eleven. The JSC line will be out-weighed from the end to end by good many pounds per player, while the backs give an even greater advantage to tbe Eastbay pigskin packers. The experience edge must go to the All-Stars since its team is practically the same as last year’s, while the Blue and Gold Bears will show new faces against the All-Stars. Starting rather unsuccessfully, , the JSC team has .been coming along, losing the first intermural encounter, tying the next two, and finally winning the last I contest 7 to 0 when Dick Suzuki was sprung loose around the end for. a 30-yard sprint to paydirt. Improvements in defense 1 has' been made and improved | blocking has given the Bears a more sustained offensive drive. Continued improvements in the next seven days will make the Bears a decided threat to the All-Stars. I The Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd i tK 9 £ 4 * fi <!

The New World-Sun the Daily Friend, Counselor and Servant. By JACK FOSTER • HARBIN, Manchoukuo, Nov. 6—A curious phenomenon of the Far East is that the closer you come to the seat of a reported war the more peaceful you are likely to find things. While I was in Peiping it looked as if the Soviet-Manchuria j border tension had approached a | cracking point. A serious con- I flict might develop any day. I took the long and barren trip to Harbin. But I discovered that nothing could be less fevered than the emotions of this northern countryside.

And this fact gives us a right to peek under the curtain like the bear that went over the mountain, “To see what he could see.” Out of the November 3, 1936 election we can now look at the results in an impartial way, we can be fair and honest with ourselves and we can look at some interesting facts. First of all we are forced to admit that America is following the lead of the other countries of the world in a socialistic sense.

Reporter Finds Peaceful Situation In Far East, Press Reports Scored •¥* Terauchi Explains Army’s Position Parliamentarians in Japan Launch Agitation TOKYO, Nov. 6 (Domei) Seventy parliamentary members of the Minseito, the largest political party in Japan, passed a resolution pledging their full support to Parliamentarism and denouncing Fascism and participation in politics by those in active military service. Similar agitation was started by other parties. In view of the flurry in political circles/War Minister Terauchi issued an informal statement clarifying the army’s attitude on parliamentary reform. The statement expressed the army’s desire to develop constitutional government peculiar to Japan, proper functioning of the Diet in accordance with the constitution, and proper repre- , sentation of the popular wishes and public opinion on the national administration. It was understood General Terauchi had given similar explanation to his colleagues in the cabinet, at the cabinet meeting this morning, denying the current rumor that army authorities are planning to establish dictatorship and abolish the Diet. Chinese Attack Another Japanese i Consul General Wa--1 kasugl Files Protest SHANGHAI, Nov. 6—Kaname Wakasugi, Japanese Consul General here, today lodged a vigorous protest against the stabbing of Shigeru Kagoshima, a Japanese, by an unidentified I Chinese at Hongkew. Wakasugi reported the incident to Mayor Wu Teh-chen and better protection for Japanese nationals. Just last week a Japanese Merchant, Yarnagishi, was shot j by a Chinese soldier in a series of anti-Japanese-Tlareups. Hhorities make representations in Tokyo and the Japanese protest in Moscow.. “You guard crossed our border!” they both insist. And one of them is just as correct as the other. For there is no definite border. j There are supposed to be six I armies of 30,000 bandits of all ' description in the country. These move along the Yulan River and the northern Korean boundary, and are in constant conflict with the Japanese soldiers who have given thousands of lives fighting them. Thev preach a philosophy that combines Korean independence with anti-Japanese, anti-Man-choukuoanism and Marxian principles. Does their help come from the Soviet? The Japanese declare it does —from Shanghai via Vladivostok. A REPUBLICAN SPEAKS 0000000 • American to a point that was * higher in almost every respect than was enjoyed by any other people in the world. Like the spreading of influenza, strange doctrines are spreading in America. And when these strange theories of economics, money, politics and religion start spreading, there is no telling where they will stop or what they may lead us into. The outstanding thing about our recent election is, of course, the personal popularity of Franklin Roosevelt. There is no question about it. He has so much charm and magnetism that his smile and voice captivates those who see or hear him. But let us forget the temperament of our American people. They can be for an idea, an ideal or a man today and against those same ideas, ideals and men tomorrow. Mr. Roosevelt was re-elected because of what he has done in the past but what he has done is as nothingcompared to what the people expect him to do in the future, and Roosevelt is only human. Some of my readers may be too young to recall what an idol Woodrow Wilson was before he made his trip to Europe. Never in the history of America was there a more popular President. And yet he died of a brokenheart. The American people worshiped him on the way up and cast him aside with indifference on the way down. They say, “History repeats itself.” Mr. Roosevelt knows thi§ and if he is as shrewd as the voters think he is, he will walk cautiously and avoid the pitfalls which could very easily lead to disaster. Another great discovery o-o-O-o-o made during: the recent political campaign was the pathetic fact that Governor Landon is not a colorful individual. He is a splendid gentleman, honest, sincere and fair. But at no time does he sparkle. He was no match for the suave, polished Roosevelt. Landon was a hick from Hickville. It was very apparent to all who know the inside story that Mr. Landon did not write the speeches which he delievered and he had the devil’s own time reading what was prepared and placed in front of him. As these lines are being written it appears that President Roosevelt will have ten million more votes than Governor Landon polled. That is a big majority but here again we must not forget that millions upon millions of our American voters have registered their disapproval of the Roosevelt administration. Ten million is a comfortable majority but here is something that may not have occurred to you. Any time that 55 per cent of that ten million majority decide that they have had enough of Roosevelt and the New Deal, Mr. Roosevelt and his policies will be all washed up and finished. And it is not at all impossible to swifch that many votes over to the Oilier side. The Republican votes will “stay put”. The Democratic problem is to hold the voters in line. As one of the millions of Republicans who opposed the New Deal, your columnist joins the majority in extending congratulations and best wishes to the President. May he live long and may the United States of America go ever onward to a greater and more glorious future. GLASS FOR DIAMOND Negro Pinned on Pavement Much ado for nothing. So it appeared after two Japanese would-be wrestlers pinned down a giant Negro who attempted to flee from the scene of alleged robbery in the heart of San Francisco’s Nihonmachi late Thursday afternoon. A sharp-looking. Negro entered the Itatani Jewelry Shop on Post Street Thursday afternoon to purchase a diamond ring. Earlier in the day the Negro was in the same shop asking for the same ring. During the course of transaction, the operator of the shop charges, the Negro had quickly changed the diamond with a glass imitation. On discovering the change soon after the Negro had left the shop, Mr. tatani called out for help. Toshio Murai, who happened to be nearby, chased the man. Murai caught up with the Negro in front of the Japanese Association hall on Laguna Street. The Negro turned around and prepared for a fight. In the meanwhile, James Kawaoka, a local Nisei, seeing the fight, gave the Negro a flying tackle and pinned him down on the side walk. With a judo hand, Kawaoka held the Negro down, while Murai called the police. By that time, Mr, Itatani had come into the scene and was seen standing by the wrestling pair with his arm held high above his head. And there was a crowd, estimated to be over 100, watching the fracas. When the police arrived and searched the Negro there was no diamond found in his possession. It is feared that he might have thrown away or swallowed the precious gem. He is in jail waiting for trial."

That is arby Texas cotton farmers continue to face the choice cA restricted product: >n on the one hand or prices below the cost of production on the J'.hrr.

There is every reason to expect it to continue at a rate determined chiefly by the supply of foreign cotton there is every reason also to expect the production ot foreign cotton, which has increased from Im than 1 2.000.000 bales in 1928 t» more than 17.000.000 bales this year, to continue to expand We my this, because we see no reason m expect the American Government to change the policies which mn chiefly responsible for this toteation A striking example of bow completely ignorant of the present situation even some Texas editors are. and h«w they lend their ool-—ps to propagandists of policies which are calculated to aggravate it. is provided by a \"canned\" edttoKal which is just now going the rounds of the Texas press We have noted R in several county wncVtim during the past month, printed as the local editors own npnmlnn in each case, with not a word changed except the name bf the town.

In CStlna and Japan a wage equal to 15 cents a day in our money is considered fair; Germany is not much better and Russia .nd Belgium are not far behind. How can an American workman compete with wages like that and how can living conditions over here be kept at their present standard if he has to? If more Americans would look to see where the merchandise they are about to buy was produced, and then refused to buy it If it came frm a oountry where starvation wages, long hours, sweat shops and unsanitary conditions are the rule, it would go far toward solving this country s employment problems and do much to prevent future depressions. 'Buy American’ should be every loyal American’s slogan from new on.” This is a conglomeration of false logic, unjound <rooonv.es, adroit misrepresentation and also of some down-right lying. The real ’rouble is that Americans do not buy enough goeds from abroad Their purchases or •finished manufactures\" from all the countries of the earth put together last year amounted to less than four dollars per capita, or about one cent per person a day. And all countries mentioned in the \"canned” editorial quoted above, except CThina. bought more from the United States than the American people bought from them.

Well, it happens that Japan is far and away Texas’ best customer And since the first of last August, a period of more than ten months. Japan has bought j about three and a half bales of j American cotton every minute of the hours of every day. Including Sundays, most of it' from Texas. And yet Texas newspapers are printing \"canned\" editorials, prepared by some lying propagandist in the East, calculated to rob Japan of the means of paying for Texas oottoo. More- SOME NOTES ON RACIAL PREJUDICES Harlem Is Paradise In Comparison to The Deep South By Joe Oyama In Miami. Florida, a white man was killed in an automobile accident with a Negro. The Negro was absolved of all blame, but the Ku Bux Klan robed in white gowns attended the funeral and Sre the body of the dead man to his final resting place. A Negro cannot be seen m the house of a white man for fear that the neighbors will call the police. Curfew bells ring at seven ?dock in the evening warning all \"niggers” to be off of the street in “white man’s town.” It was in Miami that the Max Sehmeling-Joe Louis light was called off because of public sentiment. Traditions, laws, taboo*, whispering campaigns have driven absolute mistrust of the white man into the heart of the Negrces there. Talk of the emancipation of the Negro, and they will agree with you- Talk against them, aad still they will agree with you. Cowed and treated like animals, the Negro feels like a beast in the jungle of dark human emotions. In Texarkana, Texas, a Negro was lynched by a mob and hte body burned with gasoline until the corpse stood only three feet high. Ail through. Texas, we heard of atrocities concerning the black men. Walk into a fairly decent restaurant, and yet, in the rear you will find a crew of sweating, tired Negroes washing dishes, cooking and singing. In contrast to the dark, sunbaked south. New York’s Harlem te paradise. Here we see immense department stores, swank shops, theaters, night clubs and dance halls. There are tall buildings and on Saturday nights the crowd promenading the streets are gayer, i happier and more neatly dressed ' than the straggling, loose-jointed people we see on Seventh an< * Broadway, Los Angeles, on a Saturday night. Harlem Woclworth department stores employ Negro girls. Office buildings are occupied by doctors, lawyers, attorneys, real estate brokers, commercial artists and painters. Life in Harlem is happy, at least from outward appearances, as we saw it on one Saturday night. But there is a dark side to everything. Over on the west side of New York, we can see Negro girls haggling over prioes with fat white women as to whether they should get paid ten or fifteen cents an hour. The lives of some of these Negro girls are drab. There are few socials—dances, par- ! ties, shows. Occasionally. Negro girts are hooked by the police for shop-lifting. Several years ago a serious race riot broke out in Harlem when a Negro girl was accused of shop-lifting in the Wool worth. The store was boycotted and squadrons of police were kept busy day and night to prevent sniping. Many were Injured and a few killed In New York’s one serious race riot ENT have started a detective agency and are known as \"WE THE DETECTIVES.\" RUBY HAS HIM OTO and ANNE OF GREEN GABLES have. . .

Shanghai War Over in Month, Say Nipponese Chinese Armies Will Be Pushed Back, Is Belief NEW YORK. Oct. 12—Japanese officials in Shanghai believe the fighting in that sector will be completed within a month, according to a dispatch from China by Hallet Abend. New York Time* cor. rerpondent. Japanese military officials evtnee every symptom of genuine optimism and believe that the bat. tie for Shanghai win end soon and that by early November Chinese armies In the Shanghai sector will be pushed back so far that their artillery attacks will no longer menace the Frenoh concessions and the International Settlement. Coupled with this Is the growing belief In Japanese circles that hostilities generally will probably be concluded before the end of the year, though this probably underestimates the Chlpese resource* and China's will to resist. By the end of the year Japan be. lieves she will have achieved all her major alms In North China, and if by that time the Chinese armies in the Shanghai area are defeated. Japanese here believe Tokyo would be ready to listen to truce parleys if China is willing. Chlueae SUent an Troubles -e The Chinese have thus far suppressed all references to dissensions within their own ranks, the reported breakdown in commissary and hospital arrangements and the resultin'? lessening in morale, particularly in the provincial armies which at beat have oiy a detached interest In the struggle and still arw only mercenary troops.

SATURDAY NOT^Sfll|, Negro Problem In America And Second Generation Japanese .Whenever I think of the future of the Negro problem in America, I have an indescribably disagreeable feeling and I have thought on several occasions that there are no more pitiable people than the Negroes. -j Even in present-day America, especially in the South, intolerable discriminatory treatments are openly given' the; Negroes J ■lynching, which should not prevail in a civilized country, are occasionally conducted. Anti-lynching bills ire introduced ifi Congress sometimes but they do not pass. - - t. Miss Yukiko.Kimura, who has come here from the Mainland to become secretary at the International Institute at the Y.W. €.A., graduated from Oberlin College last year May and visited 'Various places, remaining in Tennessee for a while. In that state separate seats arc provided for the whites and Negroes drawing sharp distinction. As Miss Kimura sat with a Negro friend, the latter said, \"Please go to the white people’s seat. Otherwise I would Bp ordered to leave the car on the way.\" ■ Recently a motion picture entitled \"Imitation of Life” was shown at a certain theater here, filmed from a novel of the name. It was based on the hereditary law that even, among Negro couples, occasionally children who are as beautiful as white people are born and that even among couples who look like Caucasian on first glapce, black children are born if one of the parents has Negro blcxld. The movie dealed with the tragedy resulting therefrom. A girl as beautiful as a white child, with a Negress mother, is going to school where she is believed by all as a white girl. But one dly her rfflodfec come* to the school 00 an urgent call. The tcachgr goej. our and suggests that the mother may be mistaken but the latter insisted that her Child is attending this school. So she it led into the classroom, whereupon the little girl hides her face with a book, suddenly. But the mother takes the girl Out with her. file daughtelCgets angry and asks her mother why 5Fe came to thef school and disgraced her. Her mother weeps and various tragic incidents follow after this. She finally dies following her sorrows and the daughter for the first time is stricken with rgmorse and gap to her funeral. I did not have an opportunity of seeing this fitha but it sSettfs to have caused a sensation. The first novel in the English language which I read during my student days was the 'famous \"Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Just as Sanyo's \"Nihon Gaishi\" (History of japan) furnished the motive for the Meiji Restoration, cjie famous novel by Mrs. Stowe provided the moviiig force that led to the American Civil War. Such being the nature of the book, as I rtad the book I wept several times. The Negro problem' is Jndccd the cancer of America. However, if We censuxe. the Americans for such a thing, there afe points wherein the Japanese also cannot be too proud. Discrimination against the \"eta,” belonging to the same race, prevails not only in Japan but even among Japanese here. I believe that the \"eta\" problem, or the so-called Suihcisha question, will naturally disappear with the lapse of time but it does not seem that the Negro problem in America would be solved similarly. It seems that the unfortbnate friction between the whites and Negroes will continue permanently and leave their scars. The weakest point of the Negroes is that they have no cultural background and that they have no state. The reason why the whites, abounding with superiority complex, look down on the Negroes is not ftierely. because of the color of the skin. It is because the Negron Jjave no special culture and have no state to back it. If the Japanese in America and their offspring have no powerful state back of them, if it were not for the 3,000 years of brilliant culture, they probably will have to tread the same pitiable path, as the Negroes. • When we think of this, we Japanese should feel it an honor to have Japanese forefathers an 3 our second and succeeding generations, who are to become loyal American citizens, should offer all the valuable things that are flowing within their blood, to the Stars and Stripes and strive never to stain the good name of their i ancestors, .

Ryohel Inouye, 38. formerly assistant 1 at the chemical laboratory of the Kyoto Imperial university and presently an employe of the Showa Industrial company at Muromachi, Kyobashl ward. Tokyo, recently discovered a process for extracting \"silk thread” from bean-cake. As the new fiber is of good quality. the company reportedly Is planning to Industrialize the product by turning out a daily output of 20 to 30 tons of the new product dunng this year. This new \"bean-cake fiber,” differing from staple fiber, resembles wool and raw silk In that Its principal Ingredient Is protein. It possesses the special characteristics of being soft and warm, and even If It be mixed and woven with wool and given the same dye treatment as formerly by using the same dyes. It does not blur nor blotch.

But I’ll advise him that a postponement may be necessary at the last minute. You re sure of your facts, I suppose?” \"Yes.\" Dene responded boldly; he could afford to be bold—he had burned hla boats. “You’d better be,\" said the other bluntly. \"When shall I be hearing from you?\" “Tonight or first thing tomorrow.” Then the operator interposed to say that the three minutes were up and with a hasty good-by the young man hung. up. Eavesdropping Action now! Having committed himself. Dene wanted to put that j rash premise out of his mind. He I snatched up the telephone book and looked up the address of the Hotel 1 Longford, then ripped the paragraph from the paper and. going to the desk, wrote a line for Bill: “10:40 A. M.,’’ he wrote. “Am going off here at once. Will ring you.\" He thrust clipping and note In an envelope, which he addressed and left In * conspicuous position on the mantelpiece. Then he picked up his hat and hastened to the elevator. Ths Hotel Longford was a few doors from sth avenue. Trevor parked the flivver and went Hu*:de. It was small and elegant and. quite obviously, exclusive. There were fresh flowers In the lobby and a great deal of plate glass and dullflnlshed silver work about. At the reception desk the room clerk had the air of a benign family retainer and the head waiter, hovering at the entrance to the restaurant on the far side of the long and narrow vestibule, was rotund and spruce and urbane. As. thus appraising his surroundings, the detective crossed the vestibule, his respect for Reardon’s Intelligence rose a point. He had a good eye for background, had Larry—no roaring, vulgar caravanserais of a thousand beds for him. but a qulft. respectable hotel with a tiptop clientele. There Is a certain technique about hotel inquiries, as the Scotland Yard man well knew. No need to go to the desk and disclose one’s hand by a direct inquiry. Modern hotels are full of eyes and cars. At the news stand, the florist’s, ths cigar stand, there are eyes that observe and ears that overhear as all day people come and go. And/ If these fall, there la the barber's shop, scundlng board for all tfte gossip of the house. The news stand was la charge of a bustling, black-eyed wench who looked promising and Dene drifted toward her. Above rJI. he Wanted to know whether Reardon ha<Freturned to the hotel, and. if not. where he had gone. To reach tht news stand the Scotland Yard man had to pass the open doors of the restaurant. At the sight of a handful of people at breakfast, he paused and I«t hla glance Tutt bles on the change chat Reefion might be of the a amber. ' And in effect there Reardon waa sitting at a table In the window, his elbows propped on the cloth, talking with great earnestness to a girl in a small white hat. The girl was Nancy Ayleswood. Her face was slanted to the door In quarter profile; the June sunshine pouring through the window at her side touched copper tones in the knot of hsir that rested on her slender, shapely neck.

CHAPTER 48 TREVOR’s nod was grimly resolute. \"Notwithstanding that. I tell you again, the girl’s the pivot. They'll be back.\" \"And what about Nancy? Do I tell 1 Brent your suspicious of her?” The Scotland Yard man regarded him with troubled eyes. \"Supposing I were wrong about her. Bill?\" \"You do think she’s Innocent, then?\" He sighed dejectedly. *T don’t know what to think. She seems such a splendid character, hlghsplrlted and—and plucky and all that; she rings so genuine. I can’t think It possible that she should be in what’s nothing more than a damnable' conspiracy to plunder that kind-1 hearted, good-natured old woman. And yet, In this cursed Job of mine, 1 you never know.\" He sighed again and doffed his spectacles. \"Leave her out of It. for the time being.” he went on. “I’ll give her till tofilfcht to come across with the truth. After i that—\" He broke off to look at his watch. \"It's Just on 10, Bill Run along to headquarters now and be back as soon as you can—l’d like to hear what Brent has to say about Pedder and everything before I leave for Freshwater. Give me a ring when you’re through with Brent and. If I’m still here. I’ll wait. Otherwise, you’ll have to phone me at the Yacht Club. Damnation.” he cried, glancing at his watch again. \"I wonder how long London's going to be?\" Bill left him, pipe In mouth, measuring the floor In long, restless strides. The Japanese servant, trotting In to clear away, asked him If he had breakfasted and received a moody. Impatient stare for his pains. Dene went on with his pacing. He was trying to make up his mind what to say to Manderton; the pending telephone conversation, he felt, would be crucial Uncle George was not the one to shirk responsibility; he was never afraid to answer “Yes\" or \"No” off his own bat. The question woe how to Induce him to convey to the : Home Secretary the fact that the Yard’s unofficial emissary lr. New York was in the act of gleaning Information which was likely to throw an entirely fresh light upon the priory murder. Where Inspector Manderton never flinched In his belief In his own opinion, a Minister, with public opinion to face, would be much more prone to waver. But how to bring Manderton to take the grave decision of reopening the case with the Home Office? Nothing but facts would suffice his chief. Dene knew. If he were to say that he waa on the point of arresting the real murderer, that would do the trick; but dare he risk It? Something he had overheard Mike say to Pedder at the bungalow on the previous night reverted to his ■ mind: “Whatever is done has got to be done quickly.\" were Mike's words. It certainly looked as though I they were going to strike at once. And yet—- { It was desperately hard to decide how to tackle Manderton. In an ' agony of Indecision, Trevor dropped Into a chair and picked up a newspaper. It mi*s the New York Times. It was folded back at the social page. Half-tones of debutantes; the report of a wedding; lists of people at garden parties and polo games—-absently his eye dropped down the page. Suddenly, he found hlmsef gazing at a name.

Inspector Manderton was at his home In the delectable London suburb. Heme HUI. His manner, placid 1 and quite genial, suggested the soothing eflecta of the Sunday roost beef—Dene remembered that 10:30 A. M. New York time waa 3:30 P. M. In London. “Hullo, young Dene.’ was his greeting, “the Yard’s not paying for this call, you know.” “I know,\" said his subordinate dryly, \"but It will.\" The Inspector's Isugh came rumbling 3000 miles across the ether. \"Oh, will It? That sounds promising. On to anything, are you?\" “Chief,\" Dene asked tensely, \"have you ever heard of a swell mobsman called Reardon, Larry or Lawrence 1 Reardon?\" Uncle George's card-index mind waa celebrated at the Yard: he was reputed never to forgot a name once hoard. Trevor waited anxiously. “No,\" was the unhesitating reply. \"What’s the description?” “Six foot, smartly dressed, handsome, Irish type, with dark eyes and small, very well-kept hands. Says he’s In the antique business. He’s a friend of a dealer here called 1 Hilary Pedder. He’s In with Ronts and the crowd, and a friend of Ed Cloan’s; they were at Alx to gether last summer.

But I’ll have Inquiries made about him at once and cable you. You’re going to tell me he was on the priory Job. I suppose?” The miracle-worker Marconi reproduced the strong shade of sarcasm In his voice. Dene's frayed nerves resented the Jeering note. \"Yea, I am,” he retorted hotly. \"Any evidence?\" the Inspector asked dryly. \"I’m getting It.\" \"When?\" The young man hesitated, then took his courage In both hands. \"Tonight,** he replied. \"Let me understand you correctly,\" said Manderton sternly. \"You say that by tonight you'll have evidence Implicating this chap Reardon In the priory Job and clearing Gerry Clean. Is that what you mean?\" \"This alters things,” Manderton went on. \"I’ll see the Homo Secretary at once.\" \"And get the execution postponed?\" The young man was ahaki ing with excitement.

Under the capt ion, “Can’t Take It”, he tried ft to justify ihese who have been attacking Japan, particularly the former friends like Dr. Ja- ” mes Scherer, I do not think the Japanese [ object to the criticism itself, p Everybody is entitled to his own * opinion. In 5 a free country like America, nobody can stop others from saying or writing what they want. What those who are not friendly say is to be expected. They arte accepted as a matter of coin Se. The Criticisms of the friends are what hurt and make the Japanese people mad. The propaganda, campaign is on in this Country. There are millions of people who are indifferent. They don’t.care who is right or wi|mg. There are many others who want to find out for their own fsatisfaction. Then, 1 there are those who are just wa-j vering, anxious to take sides. J When former friends of Japan! begin to criticize Japan, these i millions believe that Japan is wrong. If these attacks stop at this point, there is no harm done. But everybody knows that Japan stepped into something which was more titan expected. Depending on the outcome, the fate of Japan hangl in the balance. The boycotts are making the residents in this country and the industry in Japan feel the effects. The incomers Ibst and suffering is becoming, severe. If conditions don't linprove, many Japanese stores,- in California will have to dose their doors. The Chinese are enjoying good business because the American people sympathize with them, if the public thought Japan was right, therelwiil be a boom. This means that by criticising Japan 1 at this time, the so-called friend is going to make all the Japanese -suffer. Is this the thing for a true friend to do ? “Silence is golden” they say. When your [(friend is in trouble and needs your help, would you go out in thte public and say that he is wrong? Even if he was wrong, I thing a true frined is one who will try to defend him. Such are the beautiful relationship between friends. Yes, a friend wiU talk personally to say what he thinks. I don’t think that he will try to further spread the disgrace. In the same manner, friends of Japan should try to i make others understand why Japan is fighting China. By doing this service- even if the American people Jon’t agree fully, at least they will know what Japan wants and desires to do. Don’t yotSi think that the socalled Japan’s friends who attack her atkthe time when she needs her friends most are mistaken? I do not think it is a question of “Can’t take it.” I think it is a question of trying to. be on the popular side, to trample on who is down. It takes a brave man these days to stand for Japan. * T.K. . SAME OLD GRIPE HEARD AGAIN | . Editor, The New World-Sun: Last month pur local community had at least five benefit entertainments ' :and I was socked plenty hard.

RACCE PREJUDICE STRONGER THAN NATIONS Editor, The New World-Sun; I’ve noticed under “We the Nisei Speak,” that some Japanese think Americans of other stock than Oriental show a lack of respect for the negro because of the lack of a powerful nation backing him. Powerful nations backing him could not force me to accept a negro on the same social stand-ing—never could I pkdure myi self swimming etc. wit\\ a negro. I bet no goodlooking Japanese of second generation (or any other generation) accepts a negro socially. Ethel Hheda New Orleans, La, QUESTIONS AUTHENTICITY OF TIME ARTICLE Editor, The New World-Sun: I wish to know if the following article printed in the April issue of the Time magazine can be true. “After the capture of Nanking fell, butchery and rape reigned over the city for over a month. Many women and Chinese people were cruelly killed by the Japanese evecution squad and buried indiscriminately .On January 14, about 10,000 Chinese civilians were taken to the river bank. There the Japanese opened fire on them with machine guns, field guns and hand grenades. Then most if them were burned in huge piles and thrown into the river.” There were many other ghastly, humiliating incidents which were printed that I, as a Japanese cannot actually put down on this letter. I know that such a false, inhuman report can only be reported by Chinese officials, and it angers me furiously to think that Time magazine (which is a nationally known publication) could print such unbelievable reports. I have thought of writing to the Time magizine (a very reputable magazine, I must say) and tell them the truth but what can I do against such a popular magazine? What suggestions can you make? I shall await your answer in the paper. AYM Colorado Editors’ Note-. Time magazie bases this particular article, that reader AYM calls our attention to, on second hand information.

It is a shame that the San Francisco Japanese community should be milked continously by these selfish organizations, who think of only furthering their own interest with the proceeds received from such affairs. If such organizations have to rely on public support to continue their existence they have no right to exist but should disband.

I have enjoyed reading Mr. Imazeki’s editorial comments and admire the just policy he has observed in the presentation of news. The foundation of a growing English section has been inaugurated through his efforts. International, national, state, and city news have all been faith fully reported to us under his careful guidance and editorship. His is. an example worthy of all successors. We, the readers, thank Mr. Imazieki for his willing service to t'tie Japanese communities and hope that someday we will again have the pleasure of reading a newspaper edited by him. Y.Y. San Francisco j IMPLIES FLOWER MART ; v NEEDS BOUQUETS Editor, The New World-Sun: In your Saturday, April 16th j issue of your paper, a very unecessary article appeared in the 1 Timely topics. As you may recall the article to which I refer is that of the California Flower Market Association’s banquet. It is my belief that it will not increase your reading public’s interests to print the words “broken English in reference to the Issei. It is advisable that your paper make a retraction in the Timely Topics column. I believe that it is a great insult to our Issei who have extended the invitation to your newspaper men to attend their banquet and to be so spoken of in reference to their speech. From what source did you get get the information in stating that the power of the Japanese section of the flower market is diminishing? I would like to get some repose from you in the “Timely I’opios in the very near futnre. As you, may have noted, I am a reader of your paper who has personal interest in the welfare of the California Flower Market Association. Fumiko Sugihara.

MILITARISM i OBJECTIONABLE i Editor, Thie New World-Sun: i In your Forum section last 7 Monday there was a letter by a , San Francisco writer in which ) he (or she, mostly a he) tried to 1 glory Japanese militarism but i saying that it was Japan’s sol- - diers that made Japan what she . is today. The writer doesn’t give ) very much credit for Japanese . intelligent and resourcefulness I which I believe were the responi sible factors which made Japan . of today, and not Japan’s mil'ii tarism. Militarism in any country is a j destructive machinery. Why I GLORIFY that kind of machi- | nery when we are in dire need of I a contractive machinery to save ! I the forgotten men on the street i | from poverty and misery? I ask • you again, why GLORY militarism when we in America today ; are fighting against it to save this country from going into Center, Mrs. Sara Delano Roosevelt, mother of a statesman. Top inset. Mrs. Rosalie Di Maggio, mother of a swatsmith. Bottom inset, Mrs. Leila Rogers, mother of a screen star. The Di Maggios settled in San Francisco, there to rear a family of five boys and four girls who kept mother on the run so much that she never had time to learn the English language. Last year Mrs. Di Maggie returned to Gotham to watch Joe play a major role in sparking the Yankees to a World Series triumph. Taken on a tour of the city’s Italian section, she became so thrilled that it took her almost three hours to eat her dinner. * # * Jk/TRS. LEILA ROGERS wanted 1 her daughter. Ginger, to be a star in her chosen field. But she had enough intelligence to know that child actors seldom make adult sensations. Even though Mrs. Rogers was employed as a studio writer.- she kept the young girl at home leading an average life. At the age of 14 Ginger won a Charleston contest which led to several flattering stage offers. To New York with her went her mother, remaining by her side as guide and counsel through the rigors of vaudeville, big musical shows, then Hollywood. The “best friend is your mother” gag really applies to the Rogers case. Ginger and Leila look more like sisters —and they have as much fun together. Mrs. Rogers has been her daughter’s ace promotion manager and has pushed her into roles which made her a bright name in the movie capital’s glittering list of stars. I ~ MOTHER OF MINE C- By ILENE NAKATA , To day is Mother’s Day, which we should never forget. On Mother’s Day some people are very happy to see their mothers. Some peop x'o £ii*g very I sad because their mother is dead and they think of what mother . did for them. She is so kind to us that, when we are in trouble she’ll help us, when v/c need it. Our mother is our best friend. She! is our only friend in time of need: She loves her children no matter how good or how bad. If they have done wrong she’ll try j to correct them and put them on the Right Road. Mother is always busy at home She does all the cooking, sewing, patching, and baking. She works from sun rise to sun set. Mother’s work is never done, and if her work is dons, then there is some more to do. That is why children should always remember their mother particularly on this day. WEEKLY FORUM CONTINUED another war? , Any man v/ho tries to glorify militarism in any country has someth’ t r ; his sleeves. He is •i . . i the ca ; who is going to be bene--1 fitted by war, and any young man who is aroused by beating j , of war drums is the poor sucker ! in the game of politics.

    "paragraphs": "IVIE W S | t j and J t REVIEWS? (r <- j By JOHN KITAHARA That the Japanese people in this state have a common stake with other national minorities is nothing new. But this fact is brought home with renewed emphasis during the present meeting of the legislature at the state capital. Negroes, Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos and other racial minorities will be profoundly affected by many measures now before the legislature and their fight to maintain their civil liberties should call forth an united front of all races. Particularly important are the antidiscrimination measures introduced in the Assembly making discrimination in public places a misdemeanor. Although the fight for broader civil liberties is carried on mainly by the Negro people, the Japanese should not hesitate in placing their support solidly behind them. At the California State Conference of the National Negro Congress held in Los Angeles February 10, 11, and 12, the endorsement of following state legislation were made: Domestic Workers’ Hours; an act abolishing racial identification of applicants and oral examination in Civil Service; inclusion of domestic, agricultural and casual workers in the State Social Security and Wages and Hours legislation. The above program can be taken as a whole to fit the needs of the Japanese people, especially when a large percentage of them are employed as domestic workers in this state. On many such issues may the Japanese and other racial minorities pitch their strength for greater recognition in the economic and political life of the community. However, as the Negro Congress has shown, it is also important to remember that aside from supporting specific racial bills, the minority groups must become the consistent fighters for all legislation which will benefit the majority of California citizens. First in this fight for broader opportunities and democratic liberty for racial minorities should be the Japanese American Citizens’ League, founded to guard the Welfare of the nisei. The “Doho” urges the J.A.C.L. to immediately contact the progressive Negro organizations to unite their efforts for the struggle to protect not only themselves but the democratic rights of the American people as a whole. MINIMUM WAGE LAW What the Southern California Retail Produce Workers’ Union with its multiferous declarations, negotiations and public gestures could not (or, would not) for the Japanese boys in the fruitstand, the voice of the people may do for them soon. The voice of the People in this case is the State Legislature meeting at this time in Sacramento. By a substantial majority of seven to two the Assembly Labor and Capital Committee on February 28 recommended the passage of Assembly Bill 167, better known as the State Wage and Hour Bill. What the Japanese Company Union could not do was to raise the living standard of its members to a commonly defined American level. Its current contract with the employers is far below the inadequate agreement of last year. (1938 $22.00 and $18.00; 1939 $20.25, $lB.OO and for those with less than six months experience anything they could get.) Today the Union leaders must face a situation as embarrassing as any placed before “labor” officials: that of admitting the fact that their union contract provides for a wage scale which the people consider as even below the subsistence level. For, under the wage and hour bill, if passed safely through assembly floor, senate committee and senate, would call for the minimum wage rate of 35 cents per hour, while the union wage scale computed at ten hours a day (most workers put in about eleven to twelve hours a day) comes to about 33c and 30c. D O HO IFoi® Equality, Peace and. IPr®ogn»ess No. 35 io7 April 5, 1939 Price 5 Cents URGE NISEI TO SUPPORT BOWRON IN ELECTION Letter To Doho Nisei Unionist Urges Unity in Labor Front Editors, the DOHO: My compliments to your paper for being the only Japanese publication to give intelligent opinions on nisei labor. Being a nisei worker myself and a member of a trade union, I can’t help feeling that nisei ought to realize the fact they can’t get anywhere unless they cooperate with American trade unions to better their lot. We hear so much about discrimination against Japanese, but let me give you an example of how this could be overcome in trade unions. At first, when I joined my union, Carpenters’ Union, A.F. of L., there were a few narrow minded individuals who resented seeing an Oriental in their union. But since then, after having conversations with these individuals and showing them that we, Japanese, are just as good union men as anybody else, they changed their attitude and now welcome us as one of them. I think real Japanese American friendship must come from the rank and file of Japanese and American workers. It’s foolish, in my opinion, to spend so much money giving banquets and making overtures to “big shots” trying to get their friendship. Good will, like anything else, ought to come from below and out of daily relationship with our fellow workers and neighbors, because we have common daily problems. Challenge to all nisei trade unionists and workers is here with us today. Let’s all join the great army of American labor to boot out the reactionaries, open shoppers and those who like to fatten their stomachs at the expense of human suffering. Yours for more “DOHOS” John Uyeda Gentleman J. J. A Nisei Melodrama By HAROLD NAMBA He is known about town as Gentleman J.J.. Mild mannered is he, stocky, broad-shouldered, with an intriguing retrousse (pug) nose. His manner may be slightly affected (he prefers to be known as Gerald rather than Jerry), but this we forgive. We are not perfect, all of us. At the prime of 28 years, an ardent golf enthusiast, he gravitates with whom he thinks are the right people—human forms like K. S. and D. Y., whose dealings and double-dealings as exemplary nisei leaders are making nisei history. The tailor made clothes drape from his gentle head, down over his manly body with infinite charm. The creases are just so. What dashing vivacity, what virile lines! And yet it is also said that clothes do not make the man. How does he, such a gentleman, we wonder, keep in good graces with God and such human forms as K. S. and D.Y.? Gentleman J. J. reads the L. A. Times, he endorsed the straight Republican ticket (Merriam, Bancroft and Franklin, you know); he urged passage of Proposition No. 1, Fascist measure to bait labor curbing the freedom of the press, speech and assembly. Lately he was active in the JACL sponsored Far Eastern Research Institute making un-American speeches, backed by the consulate and other foreign interests, propagandizing Japan’s side in the Sino-Japanese conflict. Does Gentleman J. J., such a gentle man, aspire for power? Listen. In the last JACL election he ran for president on the reactionary Sugahara ticket. Rafu Shimpo, for once redeeming its many unforgivable mistakes, gave him little or no support. He declined in favor of Eiji Tanabe. Is it a trick? Is he repentent? Is he scared of the Federal Agents? Is By the time you will be reading this newspaper, the primaries of the city election in Los Angeles will be a matter of history. At the same time, you will be made to ponder that within a month another and final election will be held to select the councilmen from fifteen districts within the city. What role the Japanese - American citizens will play in the final election should be definitely decided by various Nisei civic organizations, so that their votes will not be wasted through misguidance of the basic issues involved in the forthcoming election. The central and basic issue, of course is: election of councilmen who will cooperate; wholeheartedly with ' Mayor Bowron in cleaning up the city of last vestiges of the corrupt and ousted Shaw regime. But around this central issue will revolve many minor questions, minor from the point of view of fundamental issues but, nevertheless important because they lie closest to the daily needs of the people. We refer to questions of adequate playgrounds for children, especially in the East Side district where thousands of Japanese reside, extension of free clinic, cleaning out the disease and delinquency breeding slums of Bunker Hill, Towne Ave., Central Avenue and East Side districts. Of primary importance to the Japanese resident will be the question of keeping gangsterism out of Little Tokyo. Mayor Bowron has been able to run the notorious Tokyo Club out of the city. It is now up to the Nisei civic organization to maintain a strict vigilance against the efforts of Japanese gamblers to establish another “Club” in Los Angeles. This can be done by endorsing and actively supporting the candidates who will pledge to see that this blight upon the good record of Japanese residents will be definitely removed. NISEI WORKERS SUPPORT \"DOHO” Nisei Workers, here is your paper. On this page you will find a letter from one of the numerous nisei trade unionist whose struggle for better wages hours, and working conditions meets a very sympathetic and encouraging help by this paper. You may be one of the nisei workers who have joined or are willing to join the labor movement in the ynited States. Let us know of your activities and your problems so that we can help each other in building a strong force of labor among the Japanese people to cooperate with American organized labor. The “Doho” fights consistently for the welfare of nisei labor. So, help us to build and boost the only liberal Japanese paper in the United States. Subscribe and support the “Doho”. he honest and sincere? To clear his name in connection with the nefarious Far Eastern Research Institute, whose activities are in the files of our high and mighty American Government, we find the hero of our nisei melodrama sponsoring with perspiring energy a contest for Building Better Americanism. We watch with trepidation. Nisei should unite with other racial minorities on the issue of enacting an ordinance prohibiting residential segregation and discrimination because of race or color. They should seek to provide adequate opportunities for the Japanese people and other races in city appointments and employment. An enactment of a city ordinance prohibiting incitement of racial hatred or religious persecutions should be pushed by the nisei. SUPPORT BOWRON Mayor Bowron has shown the citizens of Los Angeles, through his fine record during six months of office, that he means business in cleaning up the city of scores of grafting and corrupt city officials, who for years fattened at the public’s expense. It is clear that Mayor Bowron will be unable to carry out his program of civic betterment unless he has the backing of a majority of honest and progressive councilmen. Here nisei can join forces with other intelligent citizens of Los Angeles in giving him their full support. The ousting of reactionary candidates and the election of at least eight liberal councilmen will mean that Mayor Bowron and the city administration can carry on their good work of giving a decent, honest and fearless goverment to the city. J. A. C. L. Many nisei today are looking toward the Japanese-American Citizens' League to give them a correct guidance in voting at the final election. Here is an opportunity for the League to give endorsement for the councilmen who stand for democratic principals, who will deal fairly with the racial groups and who above all will back Mayor Bowron. We would like to see the J .A. C .L. sponsor an open forum on the coming election, inviting the respective candidates and asking them to express their stand upon the question of the Japanese population in this city, upon the extension of civil rights, upon vice and graft conditions in the city and other important questions which will affect the Japanese as a racial group and also as citizens of Los Angeles. The Young Democratic Club of Little Tokyo, of course, through their party affiliation, cannot officially take part in the city election which is non-partisan. But they can, as members, continue to give progressive and enlightened guidance to the nisei through the J.AC.L. and other major nisei organizations. Staff Writer Goes North on Leave Fumio Tanaka, whom we consider one of the ablest nisei writers, is on leave from this paper. He is now in Northern California where he will get further material for his study of the problems of the Japanese people in the state. He promises us, upon his return, to write extensively for this paper on his experiences in the north, and to continue to write brilliant articles on progressive issues. t \"DOHO\" 1 £ For Equality, Peace and Progress j £ Published Semi-Monthly by \"Doho\" Publishing Co.

Christensen defeated the incumbent candidate, W. J. Sanborn, by 1,385 votes fer the full term and 988 for the unexpired term. He took office this morning, as soon as the results of the elect‘on became final. In the Fifth District, where the second largest number of Japanese votes are concentrated, Mayor Bowron was successful in his purge of Byron B. Brainard, incumbent. Dr. Arthur E. Briggs, who was endorsed by the mayor and the various better government groups, polled 11,278 votes to Brainard’s 9,280. Although there are very few nisei residing in the 12th District, Japanese watched the re suits of the councilmanic rare there with great interest, be cause the name of Samuel W. Yorty, author of the anti-alien fishing bill, appeared on the ballot. The assemblyman, th spite of an early lead, lost out to Councilman John W. Baumgartner by less than 1,000 votfJ. Three incumbents, Lawrence, L. Larrabee, Roy J. Becker anj Gertrude H. RounsaveDe, were re-elected to the Board of Edu- , cation.

(Special) — As the feverish pitch of the capital reaches its crescendo this minXmCpremier TOKYO, Jan. 14. (Domei) — Governor General Jiro Minami of Korea was regarded early this morning as the probable No. 2 choice for premiership. Hopes virtually have been abandoned for Prince Fumimaro Konoye, the unanimous first choice. In fact, all factions, except the army, have given up this hope. It is not regarded as likely that < Prince Saionji, Elder Statesman, will have not time enough to make formal recommendation of Premier Abe’s successor to the Emperor before Monday. week-end over the search for a new man to fill the premier’s shoes, significant facts hitherto unrecognized, appeared in bold relief to political and military circles. Foremost among them is the stark reality of the people’s consciousness of how disastrous to their livelihood can be the result of inefficient domestic administration. Granted that the execution of China policies require maximum sacrifices on part of the people, they believe gross maladministration of, for instance, the rice and coal distributions, is inexcusable. The fact is, then, that the origin of the move to oust Premier Abe came from the populace rather than ; political or military leaders. The | fact that younger Diet members j angrily clamored for change in j ! administration, it is believed, j substantiate this fact. The clinching act which helped sign death warrant for Abe’s regime was General Hata’s advice from the army to the premier to “take proper action.” The army, too, realized that a j cabinet on better terms with j the Diet than Abe’s certainly j would assure less unfavorable | reception of the huge military budget in the parliament session.

California’s perennial migra- | tory problem came closer home to the Japanese when it was disclosed that field workers are imported to Orange . County mainly to pick the pea crop while recipients of State relief are unable to obtain work des- j pite requests by SRA authorities. Many Japanese growers are , affected indirectly by this controversy in Orange County. Meanwhile, the Federal government’s efforts to alleviate the condition of migratory work- ! ers from mid-western states received an opposition from California Citizens’ Association. The Association claimed that there are now already six workers for every agricultural job in the UNCLE FUJII SPEAKS Can the United States govern- | ment enter into a treaty with Japan that nullifies the alien land law of California? The court seems to hold that it | never has such a right. For in- | stance, under the existing alien I land law of California, a Japa- j nese can not own land or lease land for farming purposes. Suppose the United States makes a treaty with Japan whereby a Japanese resident in the United States will have the right to own land and lease land for farming purposes, would such a treaty grant right to the Japa- j nese resident in California of , ownership of land and the right to lease farming land? The answer under the common law and the majority of the decisions is i “no\".

And therefore, any grant of Federal funds for migrants would only aggravate the situation by keeping newcomers here until they have acquired eltgi- ; bility for state assistance. The protest was directed at Congressman Tolan, who proposed a measure to provide an appropriation for migratory ! workers stranded here. At the same time, the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee now conducting a hearing in this city heard at length yesterday a report on the migratory labor situation. Holmes Bishop, president of the California Chamber of Commerce agricultural department, said no one had aqy practical solution to the problem. ■ | State Sovereignity Over j Land Issues Clarified | the federal government the right I concerning the land. In other words, the right to regulate the land and its interests is reserved to the states and hence each state as a sovereign power has the right to enact any law as tt ! sees fit to regulate the land and j its interests. ERRONEOUS IDEAS Some people have the erroneous idea that the Japanese government may be able to the difficulties regarding thfe ownership of land by Japanegg in California by signing a treaty with the United States whiefj grants to the Japanese the ownership of land. From the above explanation, however, it will bo easily understood that such a view is wrong. Likewise even if the present treaty bej tween the United States and Japan is abrogated, nevertheless a Japanese in California under the alien land law of California is entitled to lease land for resiI dential and commercial purposes. * .

( ) jj Russo-Nippon Rapprochement Issues Used To Jockey For Positions theNEWS PEGGER BY ROY TARENO U REDS” IN COLLEGES How deep a dent, via Communistic teachings, would you suppose is being made on the thoughts and iives of nisei students now attending colleges and university? Admitted that the query is purely academic and that the answer to it can be but inconclusive at best, the question is current in view of the public attention now being focused upon the problem of infiltration of Marxian postulates within the college student bodies. At Los Angeles City College, authorities suspecting Red of the student coundemanding that all candi- ' dates for student offices name their political affiliations in terms of adult parties, members of the council refused to appropriate funds for the election, automatically cancelling the vote. The college’s dean of men charged that he had photographic proof that one of the candidates for student council presidency is a* member of the Young Communist League. Following the great to-do recently in New York over the overwhelming vote by which the American Student Union Allied to the support of the Soviet government against Finland, oldsters saw reasons to lament. Young people today, they observed, no longer pitch their support for the underdog. The elders, then, were unable to explain away the apparent fact that in a contest between David and Goliath, an organization which purports to speak for college youth of America has leaped forward manfully to the aid of Goliath. The Student Union, of course, their action on the preRiise that Finland is being cluped by England and France. This does not erase the acrid taste in the mouths of the elders by the fact that these youths, with all their physical vitality, would rather go to the support of a country with 170,000,000 people against a nation of 4,000,000. The minority presence of Communists among the nisei, be it in student circles of any size, labor group, or even JACL chapters, may be conceded as inevitable. Sheer academic inquiry into principles xian theories can be corralled within range of intellectual curiosity, but today Communistic pamphleteers from offcampus sources, have wormed their way into the confidence of not a negligible number of students on the campi. MOBILIZATION “Besides the danger of individual espionage, there is another concerning the Japanese which is not usually recognized. At present there are about 20,000 Japanese citizens visiting in the United States, and by a Tokyo order these nationals may be compelled to ‘engage in ■jfceneral mobilization enterprises’ Regardless of where they may be. “These ‘enterprises’ are not defined, but the peril of sabotage has worried more than one undercover official.” An ex-U-S. military intelligence officer and a marine officer, Dorjaid E. Keyhoe and Jay Daly, writing in a recent publication, go on: “A stiffer attitude toward actual Japanese spies would lessen the pressure on loyal American-born Japanese (nisei) and diminish danger from this source.” Keyhoe and Daly give this blanket advice to cover similar alleged situation as regards Fascist agents and Italian nisei. BOAT CREW’S Yet again, last week our U.S. District Attorney for Southern California, Ben Harrison, advocates throwing out all alien fishery boat crews in Southern California and supplanting them with Americans.

The Slavs, Italians, Portui BY JOE OYAMA By the time this article appears, I shall be somewhere in South BeRtf, Indiana, or Chicago, stomping my feet up and down trying to keep warm. My back will probably ache from three days and three nights of continuous riding in a sedan full of people. I’m being shipped back to Indiana to drive home a new car for my brother. On my way back, I’m visiting Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas — states which I have never seen before. I’ve always wanted to see the South, the South not of the “Gone With the Wind” tradition painted in idyllic colors, but the South of struggle, the Negro against his master, his master against the encroachment of northern industrialism, the slave revolts, the civil war, and reconstruction period; the present with its attendant feudalism — share cropping, tenant farming, chattel slavery. (But I doubt if I can capture all this by just driving through it, as Kenny Murase had said.) NEW’ SOUTH PROGRESS I also want to see the progress of the new South — the TV A, the National Negro Congress, NAACP, the Urban League, YMCA, youth and church groups, the organization of labor. I, too, would like to peer guese and other aliens \"paid in the remainder of this sum.

It sits on - the Southern Railroad at the tip 1 t of the Cumberland Plateau, just [ inside Jackson County of which 5 Scottsboro is county seat. Had 3 that train, freighted with its famous crime, gone a few miles further the Negroes and the women in the moving gondola 3 i cars would have been taken in “ 1 Madison County. And the whole L . world might have echoed the 1 cry against injustice threatening f the Huntsville boys. Scottsboro r would have remained the little, _ quiet, sprawling country town that it is about a huge, ill-kept but not unpleasant Courthouse Square.” NEGRO BELT I’m going to drive right into the Negro Belt, too, where lynchings are rarer. Dr. Arthur F. Raper (The Tragedy of Lynching —Chapel Hill —1933) has shown statistically that Negroes are “safer from mob deaths in the old Black Belt, where more than half of the population is Negro, than anywhere else in the South. They are in greatest danger per 10,000 Negro population from mobs in counties where the proportion of Negroes is less than one-fifth, in those counties where Negroes are not permitted ‘to stick their heads out of the train coaches.’ Such counties are often also the ones which stuck with the Union in the Civil War.” JAPANESE SCARCE Looking through the JapaneseAmerican directory, I fifid that there are only twelve Japanese in Indiana, none in Kentucky, two in Menphis, Tennessee; four in Chrichton, Alabama, and one in Mississippi. Maybe these figures do tell a lie, but I doubt if I’ll get very many free meals. PROMINENT FARMER DONATES LUMBER THERMAL, Jan. 13.—T.

Publish** Subscription Prices > Single Copy $ M Monthly 1J# Yearly . — - 1L88 The settlement of two of the major differences between Japan and Russia is only to be understood in connection with other recent events affecting both countries. The settlement guarantees payment by Japan of almost 6,000,000 yen still due Russia from Manchukuo for the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time Russia has consented to extend the fisheries agreement for another year, thus assuring Japan against interruption in 1940 of her established right to carry on this industry in Siberian waters. REASONABLY CLEAR It is reasonably clear that agreement has not been reached in the past on either point chiefly because neither country greatly desired agreement. Both matters could easily have been settled, but both were kept alive as weapons in the undeclared war that has been intermittently carried on between the two Powers. The fact that these differences h-ive now apparently been settled, together with reports from Moscow of negotiations for a final settlement of another major difference — the boundaries between Japanese and Russian controlled territory suggests that both countries have found new cause for peaceful relations. In the case of Russia, the military weakness revealed by her Finnish campaign is doubtless of primary importance. TWO REASONS Ar for Japan, that country has two excellent reasons for seeking better relations with j Russia: first, her involvement in China, which has weakened her 4 ability to resist Russian pressure, and second, the approaching expiration of her trade treaty with the United States. j The Japanese position has become increasingly isolated with the democracies alienated by her treatment of their interests in China, and Germany shut off by blockade and allied with her antagonist to the north. Hence Jauan s interest in meeting Russia halfway and concluding the present agreement.—N. Y. Times."

Open Season Now. No Limit!\" YOUR INCOME TAX No. 6 SIMPLIFIED RETURNS FOR OPTIONAL TAX . . . The Revenue Act of 1941 provides a simplified method of computing Income lax In the rase of individuals whose gross Income Is derived wholly from salaries, wages, or other compensation for personal services, dividends. Interests, rent, annuities, or royalties, and dooa uot exceed $3,008. A new form 1040 Abos been provided lor taxpayers who are entitled lo nnd elect to use such methods. A table on the reverse side of the form shows the amount of lax on Increasing amounts o: gross Income after the proper allowance of $4OO for each dependent. If any. The tax under the simplified method It the tame for each $25 block of gross Income (lest allowance for dependents) falls to determine his tax. A flat reduction of 10 percent hat been made in arriving at the amount of tax shown In the table for deductions such as charitable contributions and taxes paid, so thjt the taxpayer whose uses this method does not list these but receives an automatic deduction of 10 percent. Under the simplified method, the status of a person on tho last day of the taxable year Is tho governing factor ln_ determining the exemption level (s<6o for single persons and mar ried persons no; living with husband or wife, nnd $1,500 for married persons living together) as well as the credit for dependents. A husband and wife living together nn the Inst day of the taxable year may -file separate realms on Form 10 tOA If tho gross Income of each Is from the proscribed sources nnd does not exceed 13000. If tho file a separate return, the tax Ilabllly of each under the simplified method Is the tax Imposed upon a single person. If husband and wife file separate returns and only one elect to make a return on Form 1040A. the tax liabllty of the one ao electing It the tax Imposed upon single pereons. If they file a single joint return, or If only one spouse makes a return,, or If only one spouse makes a return because the other spouee has no gross Income, the tax liabllty is the tax Imposed upon a married person. Tile use of the simplified method is optional with the taxpayer, hut once an election has been made for any year. It Is Irrevocable for that year. If a taxpayer flies a return under the simplified method for tho taxable year, he may not thereafter file a return under the general provisions nt ■he law for that yiuir. Conversely, if ho files n return under the genera! provisions for any taxable year, be may not I hereafter file a return under Hie simplified method for that year.

Returning from the Hawaiian Islands here he was sent by the Fellowship of Reconciliation to study the problems of the Nisei, Dr. Sehmoe has brought to light some keen observations of our present-day problems. The so-called “Nisei problems’’ today, in the midst of the war hysteria, is primarily a problem of human relations, he said. To solve it, there arises the necessity of establishing a sound and friendly relationship between individuals. From the standpoint of the group, it is advisable for the Nisei, according to Dr. Sehmoe, to make contacts with college presidents, high school principals, leading business men, and those who hold positions of trust and responsibility in social, political, religious and other organizations. To quote Dr. Sehmoe; “I think too many of .us are forgetting that we are all human beings and that we are all created equal. We are all brothers and regardless of deasons we are now neighbors and we would do well to recognize this I fact and treat each other as such.” If war should break out between the United States and Japan, what are some of the practical things that the Nisei should do? Dr. Sehmoe believes it would be practical and proper to: 1. Seek good and dependable Caucasian American friends. 2. Establish some form of communication among the group so that it may be well informed. As for the Hawaiian Islands, Dr, Sehmoe is confident that untoward incidents there will be minimized even should war break out. Three years ago, about 00 per cen£ of the total population was Japanese, including both citizen and non-citizen groups. That proportion now is about 37 per cent due to the large recent influx of defense workers from the ■ mainland and reinforcements to 1 the Army and Navy, According to the 1940 census there are now 157,50 S Japanese (Including both American citizen and alien groups) out of a total population of 420,- | 000. Of the 157,005, only 17.200 are alien Japanese. The remainder j are American citizens. Of the citizen group, between 20,000 and 25.000 still retain dual citizenl ship, Dr. Sehmoe declared. It is Dr. Schmoe’s opinion that war between the United States and Japan is further away now than it was three months ago. As for the situation in Canada, Dr. Sehmoe reported that there has been no notable increase in hysteria or race discrimination directed against the 2000 Japanese in Vancouver. Canadian concentration camps are reported to hold about 7000 civilians in them, but of this number very few are Japanese, he said. 8600 Issei Now Reside in Canada, Census Reveals V i VANCOUVER, 8.C., April 20— i According to the reported figures 1 of the national registration con- j ducted throughout Canada last j summer, the number of Japannese residents born in Japan is 8,600, and of this total 5,600 were men and 3,000 women. Compared to this, the number of Chinese residents born in China is; 32,260 31,070 men and .1190 women.

JAPAN NOTED i I - - ... j Thousands of New Factories Feared to I Cause Repercussions TOKYO, April 20—Thousands ; of new factories have given Japan a wartime boom which, foreign observers agree, may ’ produce important and possibly disturbing consequences. Spurred by the army, new plants are mushrooming in already overcrowded manufacturing areas, while government oressure continues to centralize industry toward wartime production. More than 60 per cent of the countrys’ complex manufacturing organization is engaged in military production. Immediate peace would bring economic hanges, observers say. Demand Expected But the army’s concerted effort to increase the output of war products, despite the handicaps imposed by American embargoes and shortages of raw materials, indicates that the military foresee a continuing emergency. Linked with military plane for j a vast industrial organization 1 responsive to commands of the | General Staff is a drive now under way for a dosed economy. I The Army at first proposed re--1 placement of civilian factory managers by government officials, but a bloc of powerful Osaka business men defeated the attempt. The two factions now are debating a projected sharp curtailment of profits, in line ' with the “new national structure.” Regular work “holidays,” usually one idle day per week, are enforced in a majority of plants because power is insufficient for all of industry. This weakness was first disclosed in January, 1940, when hundreds of factories shut down completely due to a power fail- ; ure after a seve/e drought. Industry has expanded beyond the capacity of hydroelectric plants and reservoirs. Industrial expansion has profoundly affected the people. Japan still is a nation of small I shopkeepers. In thousands of j j tiny stores and on numerous i farms, members of the family gather at night to do piecework for spinning mills and toy manufacturers. Much of their cash income is earned this way. These jobs are being absorbed in the centralization of industry. Spinning and weaving, the country’s major export business, maintained 36,871 factories in 1939. Thousands of these were small establishments, working a few looms on contract from the exeat plants. But they replaced the part-time workers in countless homes. Increased emphasis upon wartime production, with the consequent curtailment of export manufacture, further has reacted against these casual workers. Industry now wants skilled mechanics who can handle complex machines in large factories. Nisei Solon Seeks Funds for School HONOLULU, April 20—An appropriation of $27,500 for the purchase of equipment and sup- i plies for use in vocational agri- , cultural courses offered by Oa- I hu schools participating in the i benefits of the Smith-Hughes | act was asked in a bill intro- ( duced in the house last week by j Rep.

His hair was red -so we thought he was Irish, but lie corrected us and told us that he ■was of German extraction. He was an instructor in the army. Tomorrow he was going to serve another six years in the Ameri can army. “I think,” he said, “the United States should keep her boys on this side of the water. The passage of the LendLease bill gives Roosevelt dictatorial powers; I’m afraid that as soon as we begin convoying ammunitions to the British, some of our warships will be sunk.” This boy had a scapegoat, and it was labor. He said, “I think these guys striking against the government in the defense industries are a bunch of dirty ! They’re getting from $lO to $l2 a day, and here we poor guys in the army are slaving away for $2l to $3l a month. If necessary, I think the army should be called out and the strikers forced back to work.” “A dangerous man,” we thought. Americans of Spanish Descent , . . Leaving Gilroy, we picked up two Americans of Spanish descent from Camo Ord. One of them said. “Don’t worry; you’ll be doing the same thing' whfcn the army gets you; you’ll be standing on the side of the highway, hitch-hiking. I used to own a car just like yours, but like a fool I was I sold mine before I went in. The guys who own ears in the army are lucky. They furnish transportation for the other boys and make expenses. You can get rides to Los Angeles for as little as $5 roundtrip. “I’ve been in the army one month now. I’m an old-timer!” College Graduate . . . The last boy we picked up was a college graduate stationed at the Presidio, in Monterey. He had volunteered. A graduate of the University of Utah, he said, ‘Tve volunteered because I wanted to get my training period over with.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, April 20 II your color happens to be brown, black or yellow, and if you happen to be sensitive about your skin, then there aren’t very many places that you can go to in a small California town, especially if it is well past midnight and it is raining outside. Here you are inside of a small Chop Suey house, 250 miles from home and 250 miles from San Francisco. It is raining outside and a cold wind comes blowing in from the half open door. With overcoat on, you eat your noodles. At one end of the counter, a Filipino and a Negro are drinking- beer. The Negro is telling tpe Filipino that Hitler is already in New York, that the distance from New York to Chicago is only 200 miles, that when Hitler comes out here, he (the Negro) is going to hide. Suddenly a Nisei sitting at the opposite end of the counter exclaims, “Who in the hell said that Hitler is in New York? How could he be when he hasn’t even crossed the English Channel?” There is silence, and the Filipino beckons to the Nisei, “Come and sit by me. Listen,” he says, “T served in the American navy for fifteen years. I have been all over the world. I left home when I was eighteen years old. “Listen, I want to tell you a funny story.” He turns to the Negro. “Don’t get mad. You know, we are all like brothers. When I was with the Asiatic fleet, our ship went 'to Vladivostok, Russia. There was a colored boy with us named William. Oh, he was as black as coal! We went to a Japanese tea house, and when the Japanese girl saw William she went up to him and began rubbing his hand. She would rub his hand and look at it. Then she licked her fingers and rubbed it some more. We had to explain to her that William’s color was natural. Natural, “From there we went to a Russian inn. When the Russian girl saw Wililam, she ran away—-terrified.” “Yeah, there are a lot of people who have never seen a Negro before,” said the Negro. “I was on a train one time—l think it was in Montreal. A little white aoy kept looking at me, so his father told him not to be scared. He told his little boy that I was a colored man. The little my came up to me and became friendly. We even played games. “Another time I was in a small town in Rhode island. A man nvited me over to dinner. He was a prominent man in town, i lawyer. After dinner I took his daughter to a theater. This man rad had pleasant dealings with miored people before,“ [ “I was in Galveston. Texas,” said the Filipino, “our ship decked there. I went to a town near | Beaumont. I got on a street car and I saw a sign, ‘White People jOniy.’ Then I saw another sign near the rear of the car, ‘Colored Section.’ ‘Well,’ I said to myself. T am entered.’ I didn't know what to do. So I stood in the aisle and hung on to the strap over my head. Do you know what I did? 1 put one foot in the colored section, and the other in the white section. Finally the conductor came up to me and told me to sit down. I sat in the white section.” “White people think we're always happy,” said the Negro, “because they always see us laughing, but underneath we’re sad because they don’t even pay us wages we can live .on. When I first came here in 1923 there wasn’t much prejudice against the Negroes. But since then a lot of Sout/.e'rn people have come in here and they have ! poisoned the minds of the people against us colored folks.” 1 “I’m not like other Filipino boys,” interrupted the Filipino. “I am fifty-three years old. I served in the American navy. 1 ,go anywhere I please. I know. | sometimes, I go to a place and I the white people don’t like it. They look at me funny. Some of them make dirty remarks, but 1 j ignore them. I have my good time anyway.” ‘‘lt’s all right,” says the color|ed man, “but sometimes they grab a hold of you and throw | you out bodily.” i Wrong Side of Fence . . . Leaving San Miguel, we parkled on the side of the highway ' outside Camp Roberts and watched the boys drilling in blue work uniforms. They all carried guns. One company was “at ease.” A number of the boys were smoking. We noticed a number of Nisei in the ranks. One group of soldiers saw us sitting in the car on the opposite side of the highway, so they jokingly yelled, “Hey, you slacker! You’re on the wrong side of the fence!” Just then a car drove off, a lady was inside of it laughing, and one soldier yelled. “Don’t laugh, lady, your old man will be in here soon enough!” One officer was trying to show-off. He had a cigarette in his mouth. He grabbed a rifle and lunged at the throat of another officer, who very carefuly retreated backward, ducking left and right. They repeated the performance several times for the benefit of the rookies looking on. Poet Hitch-Hiker . . . On the way to Salinas, we gave a ride to a Salinas Junior College student. He told us that he had originally come from northern Mississippi. After finishing school here. h<> was 'going to return there, “Everybody in California,” | he said, “sppms tp be in a iuit Telephones:Fillmore 0095-0134 ummmmimminimmmmmiimm Perkins Ranch | Hand, 57, Ends His Own Life, SACRAMENTO.

Matsuoka Terms Nippon - Soviet Fact “Natural” • HAILAR, April 20 (Domei) —“lf the Japanese people were surprised at the signing of the Nippon-Soviet Neutrality Pe-t they’re unable to meet the violently changing world situation of today,” Matsuoka told reporters this morning while enroute to Hailar from Manch^’di Between puffs on his favorite briar pipe and gulps of whiskey, the Foreign Minister called the end to the long ye a r s of animosity between his country and Russia a “nalur a 1 development of t h times.” Matsuoka expressed admiration for the popularity of Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini among peoples. Regarding his part in completing the long-sought treaty with Russia, Matsuoka was modest. “I have only carried put my duties as Foreign Minister,” he said. “It’s like a soldier going lo battle. There’s nothing to be surprised about it.” No Amount of Violence Can Crush Out Light of Freedom in Sou! Of Embattled Greeks, Picaeon Says “The Greeks are a brave people, and no amount of physical violence could ever crush out the lii*lit of freedom in their soul.” This was the view of Elias Picaeon, consul general of Greece, in an exclusive interview with the New World-Sun Daily at his office in the Marshall Square building, 1182 Market Street, of this city. Greece is bearing the brunt of a terrific- Nazi onslaught in the Balkans. In San Francisco Consul General Picaeon remained calm and confident that the ultimate victory lies with the democracies. “No dictator can subdue for long a whole continl.it like Europe because his very conquest stirs up new problems which in the end will overtake him,*’ he declared. “As an example, Alexander the Great swooped down from the north into Greece and conquered our ancestors in classical times, but his empire was short-lived. “In the present ease, the conquered peoples of Europe are cherishing great expectations of the part which the United States will play in our fight for freedom, The tre* mendous power of this country, both materially and in manpower, will undoubtedly tip the scale in our favor—in favor of freedom everywhere,” Picaeop, who is §5 years old, was a of Premier Alexander Cprizis in the military academy at Corfu. He was also a friend of the late Dictator Metaxas, whose photograph hangs in his office. The Greek Consul General declared that there are about half a million Greeks in the United States’, most of them being second generation and therefore citizens of this country. About 7,000 of them now reside in San Francisco. As a narting message, Picaeon declared: “I am afraid the peoples of the small countries of Europe will have to suffer in the present conflict. But they will bullets and tanks can never crush free spirit.” Monday, April 21, 1941 CROWDS IN MANCHUKUO HAIL MATSUOKA BOUND FOR TOKYO RETURNING FROM SUCCESSFUL TRIP Foreign Minister Defends Treaty as Beneficial to Japan DAIREN, Manchukuo, April 20 (Domei)—Large crowds gathered to give Foreign Minister Matsuoka a resounding ovation on his arrival here by plane from Hailar shortly after noon tod a y. Matsuoka immediately proceeded to the residence of Takuichi Omura, president of the South Manchurian Railway I Company, where he will stay overnight to complete a report on his five-week tour of Europe. The Japanese Foreign Minister was to leave the Shushi airdrome at 8:30 Monday morning for Tokyo. Soviet Russia’s recognition of Manchukuo “constitutes a major step” in the new Manchukuoan history, Matsuoka asserted in a radio broadcast from Manchuli over networks of Manchukuo and Japan. Matsuoka declared that he saw evidence everywhere that the people of Italy and Germany shared the same destiny with Japan. The Foreign Minister decried attempts “to fish in troubled waters” for Japan and Manchukuo, aserting that they would j not be able to reach their destinies if they lacked determination or begrudged efforts. Matsuoka Points to Strengthening of Japan’s Position MANCHOULI. April 20 (Domei ) Strongly defending the week-old Nippon - Soviet Neutrality Pact as benefiting both countries, Foreign Minister Matsuoka characterized as “childish” foreign comments that the USSR was the sole nation to gain from the treaty. He devoted one-third of a lengthy statement reviewing his observations during the five-week journey to the Axis and Soviet capitals to prove the falseness of contentions that Japan would not profit from the pact. “It is obvious that international treaties as important as this can’t be concluded unless both parties clearly gained definite benefits from it,” Matsuoka said. He admitted that the treaty was satisfying to the Soviets but pointed out th e great strengthening of Japan and Manchukuo’s positions. I would not have felt bound to enter commitments detrimental to our country or Manchukuo,” he added. He declared sarcastically that he hadn’t joined the ranks of “great men” who would conclude treaties benefiting the other party even at the sacrifice of their own nation. He discerned a parallel between arguments that Moscow was the only one to gain from the Nippon-Soviet pact and the contention that Berlin was the sole beneficiary from the Tri-partite pact concluded last year. “They’re aimed to arouse resentment among our people against our allies,” Matsuoka exclaimed. The Japanese Foreign Minister observed a different world in Soviet Russia from what ho saw in 1933 when he passed through the USSR to Geneva. “In contrast to the looks of hunger among the Russians eight, years ago, a relative prosperity seemed to prevail,” Matsuoka said. uiiiiiimmiiiiiiinimiiiiiiimiiniiiiiiniiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimmiimiiimmiiiiti I Mfclrite I BRAND I 9votf (prvducfa | | SMOKED -SALMON BABY-CLAM | | TRENCH -MUSHROOM MANDARIN - ORANGE | Pacific Trading Co. g.r., LJL, SACRAMENTO I | APR 211341 Pacific Mail FROM NIPPON April 24—Yawata Mans. ******* TO NIPPON April 17—Kamakura Maru."

A consequent lag in long standing trade talks between American and Russian officials here was expected. At the same time, it was indicated that aid promised China would be sped. In that connection.

Plans for the currency arrangement were announced last fall. Technical details have held up the pact Secretary of State Hull reiterated his belief Monday that the RussianJapanese accord was less important than it seemed and at the same time appeared to minimize the character of the conversations held by Constantin Oumansky, Soviet ambassador, with State department of. ficials since last summer.

Tefepho™! IS&rt MM Wediies., April 23,1941 Japanese Occupy Foochow FUKIEN PORT f CAPTURED Advance of Troops , Southward from Ningpo Also Reported SHANGHAI, April 22 Japanese troops, seeking to cut vital supply lines of the Chinese government at Chungking, have occupied the important Fukien province port of Foochow and are moving inland along the Min river, the Japanese announced Tuesday. Occupation of Foochow, which was the .last treaty port of China, followed the seizure by the Japanese of Ningpo, Chekiang province port approximately 300 miles north. It appeared the Japanese had met no opposition at Foochow. The mouth of the Min river had been blockaded for the past year. Foochow, with about 350.000 population, for many years has been one of China’s chief tea market*. Collapse of Sino Resistance Seen TOKYO, April 22 (Domei) Driven off by J apanese forces which effected a successful landing operations, Chinese troops in the KikowFenghwa sector south of Ningpo have fallen in great confusion, field dispatches reported. Following the capture of Ningpo, four Japanese detachments continued their southward advance and took Shihki, strategical post near Ningpo, Sunday. These Japanese troops after a fierce drive along the banks of the Yuchao river also took Yuanchekiao and Fangkiao, 10 miles south of Ningpo., The Chinese forces were reported to be making desperate efforts to hold their defense line connecting Fenghwa and Kikow against Japanese onslaughts, but Japanese dispatches from the field indicated that the collapse of opposing troops in this sector seemed imminent. Transsiberian Railway Seen as Blockade Leak j Supplies Pour Into Germany Despite British Sea Efforts SHANGHAI, April 22—Unofficial British trade observers in Shanghai declare that the Transsiberian. railway has become one of Germany’s principal means of circumventing the British sea blockade. Usually well informed foreign economic experts here estimate that more than 100,000 tons of vital strategic materials pour over this rail line into Russia every month. If all these shipments reach Ger-many—and these observers express belief that they do —they would equal the amount that would be carried by one freighter slipping thru the British blockade each day. While this is a relatively small amount, the experts consider it important to Germany. Trains have been reported carrying cotton brought from the United States and Brazil; vegetable oils and food fats from China and America: American copper wire and shoe leather; copra from the Philippines and the Netherlands East Indies; crude rubber, of undisclosed origin, shipped through Manila; Peruvian and Java sugar and many products of Japan and China. Docks and warehouses at Dairen, principal port of entry for Manchukuo, and at Vladivostok, Far Eastern terminus of the railroad, are report-: ed piled to overflowing with goods awaiting rail transit, as are the railway yards and station platforms at Manchuli. near the Manchukuo-Si-berian border. _ . (The Transsiberian railway was closed to foreign passengers between April 17 and May 3, according to a Sunday dispatch of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi. The German travel .agency at Harbin, however, said that they understood the Russian authorities to Close the rail service down entirely to foreign passengers from May 3 except to a quota of 300 Germans who commute between Tokyo and Berlin. It may mean that intensification of Germany-bound cargo necessitated the order. —Ed. Note.) Publisher of Time , Life Guest At Chungking NEW YORK.

Stockholm Red Press in Hot Attack Over Pact Communist Paper Cites Soviets iu Axis as Insult STOCKHOLM, April 22 While the Swedish press is extremely reticent in its comments on the SovietJapanese pact, the Svenska Dagbladet, official organ of the Swedish Communist party, in an editorial made a violent attack against the newspaper of the Social Democrat party, the Social Demokraten, for having dared to headline the agreement: “Soviet Joins the Three-Pow-er Pact?” The Communist paper said it was an insult to the Soviet Union, that the Social Demokraten had once before falsely pretended that the So-viet-German pact was a military alliance and that “the Social Demokraten is more German than the Germans themselves.” The whole tone of this violent attack seems to indicate that instructions issued by the Comintern to its followers abroad as to the interpretation to be given to the Soviet-Ja. panese pact do not agree with the optimism voiced in Berlin and Rome. 200 Exnected for Annual U.C.

Matsuoka Gives Statement on Europe Tour Prepared Release Handed at Station To Foreign Newsmen TOKYO, April 22—(Domei)— Foreign Minister Matsuoka's prepared statement handed to foreign correspondents is as follows: “I am back at Tokvo again. My journey to ,Germany Snd Italy took six weeks. I had a series of extremely useful conversations with leaders of both countries with whom-1 have formed personal acquaintanceship, I realize fully the truth of the proverbial saying that to see one better than to hear a hundred times, for I feel I can now speak with better authority on the situation in western Europe, having ascertained on spot many a doubtful point through my own eyes. “This I believe will prove beneficial in no small measure in conduct of our foreign relations. I have also become acquainted with eminent leaders of the Soviet government including Stalin with whom I’ve had two frank and friendly con. versations. In fact, it was he who made the prompt decision at the last stage of negotiations regarding the recently concluded Soviet-Japa-nese neutrality pact. “This is only pne of many examples how great leaders of powers are today disposing quickly the affairs of the state invplving some-times-the fate.of their nations when inter national situation is so-'TuU of swift and surprising changes. ■ , ‘ Vacillation and hesitation are indeed fatal. ‘■We should, not confuse deliberation with procrastination. “Just as tripartite pact does not affect the relations of the tri-powers in relation to the Soviets., the JapanSoviet neutrally pact and declaration does not affect in the least the tripartite pact which remains the immutable basis of our foreign policy. . . . “On the contrary the neutrality pact is a reinforcement In « sense of the tripartite pact. “There, has of course been no misunderstanding or misiapprehension among the three allied governments in connection with the neutrality pact. “Nothing proves this better than the fact that both Germany and Italy sincerely are welcoming the conclusion of the pact. “The pact Is an eloquent indication of the improvement in our relations with the Soviets and together with the tripartite pact, Sino-Japa-nese treaty, of last year- and the recent mediation in the Franco-Thai dispute, stands as a fitting symbol of ‘hakko ichliu’ which inspires the foreign policy pf Japan,, aimed at universal peace and good neighborliness. “Finally if my European journey contributed ever so little to the cause Pf our nation it .is -above all due to the gracious influence of our Imperial house and also to the great power of our country—the Japanese empire.” French Regrets Saigon Scuffle Of Three Soldiers Injured Japanese Taken to Army Hospital for Care SAIGON.

TO CHANGE POLICY Cites Treaties as Proof of Nippon's Peaceful Purpose 1 TOKYO, April 22—(Domei)—For-eign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka expressed. belief Tuesday night that the United States would adopt a policy of peace toward Japan as a -result of Japan’s peaceful policy in an interview with Japanese newspapermen following his arrival here. “There is no nation of earth which has ever succeeded in concluding three great international treaties and in addition successfully mediated a war all, within a short period of six months,” Matsuoka declared. The conclusion of treaties with Wang Ching-wei’s regime at Nanking, the tripartite pact with Germany and Italy and the recent Soviet neutrality pact in addition to the mediation of the ThailandFrench Ihdo-China war proved Japan’s peaceful policy, Matsuoka averred. “In view of these facts and since the United States is posing as a champion of the cause of peace. I believe the United States will chant paeans upon being appraised of Japan’s . true intentions,” Matsuoka said. Asked whether he w T as planning a hon-aggression pact with the United States Matsuoka stated .“I do not know,” adding that “so far no move has been made on my part.” Questioned whether Russian troops in the Far East would be withdrawn with the signing of the pact, Matsuoka smiling!*' replied “You’ll have to ask Molotov or Stalin.” The foreign minister exchanged questions and answers with newspapermen at his official residence. He expressed his appreciation for the full and enthusiastic support of the press for -the fulfillment of his mission to Europe. Questioned on the future of diplomatic developments centering around the conclusion of the neutrality treaty, Matsuoka adroitly sidestepped the question by saying “I am not in a position to say anythi beyond what has been announced, especially as to the future developments. I leave it to you to make your own comments.” As to possible reaction of the con- ' elusion of the neutrality treaty and of the foreign minister’s visit to Ger- I many and Italy and on the settlement of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Matsuoka also ducked questions, stating he could not make any remarks on the matter as it will affect his diplomatic strategy. Asked whether or not any conver- , sations took place in Europe regarding the reinforcement of the tripartite alliance and as to the relationship between the tripartite pact and the neutrality pact, Matsuoka replied: • • .“The tripartite alliance cannot be strengthened any further. The neutrality, pact with Soviet Russia does not in the least conflict with the tripartite alliance. On the contrary, the conclusion of the neutrality pact, I think, will serve to help In achieving the great objective of the tripartite alliance.” Questioned regarding the possible reaction of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact, Matsuoka said, does not include any secret understandings. He, expressed belief it would lead to early settlement of questions between the two nations. He voiced the opinion that the neutrality pact W’ould have a “favorable effect” on pending Soviet-Japa-nese trade and fishery questions.

Tefepho™! IS&rt MM Wediies., April 23,1941 Japanese Occupy Foochow FUKIEN PORT f CAPTURED Advance of Troops , Southward from Ningpo Also Reported SHANGHAI, April 22 Japanese troops, seeking to cut vital supply lines of the Chinese government at Chungking, have occupied the important Fukien province port of Foochow and are moving inland along the Min river, the Japanese announced Tuesday. Occupation of Foochow, which was the .last treaty port of China, followed the seizure by the Japanese of Ningpo, Chekiang province port approximately 300 miles north. It appeared the Japanese had met no opposition at Foochow. The mouth of the Min river had been blockaded for the past year. Foochow, with about 350.000 population, for many years has been one of China’s chief tea market*. Collapse of Sino Resistance Seen TOKYO, April 22 (Domei) Driven off by J apanese forces which effected a successful landing operations, Chinese troops in the KikowFenghwa sector south of Ningpo have fallen in great confusion, field dispatches reported. Following the capture of Ningpo, four Japanese detachments continued their southward advance and took Shihki, strategical post near Ningpo, Sunday. These Japanese troops after a fierce drive along the banks of the Yuchao river also took Yuanchekiao and Fangkiao, 10 miles south of Ningpo., The Chinese forces were reported to be making desperate efforts to hold their defense line connecting Fenghwa and Kikow against Japanese onslaughts, but Japanese dispatches from the field indicated that the collapse of opposing troops in this sector seemed imminent. Transsiberian Railway Seen as Blockade Leak j Supplies Pour Into Germany Despite British Sea Efforts SHANGHAI, April 22—Unofficial British trade observers in Shanghai declare that the Transsiberian. railway has become one of Germany’s principal means of circumventing the British sea blockade. Usually well informed foreign economic experts here estimate that more than 100,000 tons of vital strategic materials pour over this rail line into Russia every month. If all these shipments reach Ger-many—and these observers express belief that they do —they would equal the amount that would be carried by one freighter slipping thru the British blockade each day. While this is a relatively small amount, the experts consider it important to Germany. Trains have been reported carrying cotton brought from the United States and Brazil; vegetable oils and food fats from China and America: American copper wire and shoe leather; copra from the Philippines and the Netherlands East Indies; crude rubber, of undisclosed origin, shipped through Manila; Peruvian and Java sugar and many products of Japan and China. Docks and warehouses at Dairen, principal port of entry for Manchukuo, and at Vladivostok, Far Eastern terminus of the railroad, are report-: ed piled to overflowing with goods awaiting rail transit, as are the railway yards and station platforms at Manchuli. near the Manchukuo-Si-berian border. _ . (The Transsiberian railway was closed to foreign passengers between April 17 and May 3, according to a Sunday dispatch of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi. The German travel .agency at Harbin, however, said that they understood the Russian authorities to Close the rail service down entirely to foreign passengers from May 3 except to a quota of 300 Germans who commute between Tokyo and Berlin. It may mean that intensification of Germany-bound cargo necessitated the order. —Ed. Note.) Publisher of Time , Life Guest At Chungking NEW YORK.

Stockholm Red Press in Hot Attack Over Pact Communist Paper Cites Soviets iu Axis as Insult STOCKHOLM, April 22 While the Swedish press is extremely reticent in its comments on the SovietJapanese pact, the Svenska Dagbladet, official organ of the Swedish Communist party, in an editorial made a violent attack against the newspaper of the Social Democrat party, the Social Demokraten, for having dared to headline the agreement: “Soviet Joins the Three-Pow-er Pact?” The Communist paper said it was an insult to the Soviet Union, that the Social Demokraten had once before falsely pretended that the So-viet-German pact was a military alliance and that “the Social Demokraten is more German than the Germans themselves.” The whole tone of this violent attack seems to indicate that instructions issued by the Comintern to its followers abroad as to the interpretation to be given to the Soviet-Ja. panese pact do not agree with the optimism voiced in Berlin and Rome. 200 Exnected for Annual U.C.

Matsuoka Gives Statement on Europe Tour Prepared Release Handed at Station To Foreign Newsmen TOKYO, April 22—(Domei)— Foreign Minister Matsuoka's prepared statement handed to foreign correspondents is as follows: “I am back at Tokvo again. My journey to ,Germany Snd Italy took six weeks. I had a series of extremely useful conversations with leaders of both countries with whom-1 have formed personal acquaintanceship, I realize fully the truth of the proverbial saying that to see one better than to hear a hundred times, for I feel I can now speak with better authority on the situation in western Europe, having ascertained on spot many a doubtful point through my own eyes. “This I believe will prove beneficial in no small measure in conduct of our foreign relations. I have also become acquainted with eminent leaders of the Soviet government including Stalin with whom I’ve had two frank and friendly con. versations. In fact, it was he who made the prompt decision at the last stage of negotiations regarding the recently concluded Soviet-Japa-nese neutrality pact. “This is only pne of many examples how great leaders of powers are today disposing quickly the affairs of the state invplving some-times-the fate.of their nations when inter national situation is so-'TuU of swift and surprising changes. ■ , ‘ Vacillation and hesitation are indeed fatal. ‘■We should, not confuse deliberation with procrastination. “Just as tripartite pact does not affect the relations of the tri-powers in relation to the Soviets., the JapanSoviet neutrally pact and declaration does not affect in the least the tripartite pact which remains the immutable basis of our foreign policy. . . . “On the contrary the neutrality pact is a reinforcement In « sense of the tripartite pact. “There, has of course been no misunderstanding or misiapprehension among the three allied governments in connection with the neutrality pact. “Nothing proves this better than the fact that both Germany and Italy sincerely are welcoming the conclusion of the pact. “The pact Is an eloquent indication of the improvement in our relations with the Soviets and together with the tripartite pact, Sino-Japa-nese treaty, of last year- and the recent mediation in the Franco-Thai dispute, stands as a fitting symbol of ‘hakko ichliu’ which inspires the foreign policy pf Japan,, aimed at universal peace and good neighborliness. “Finally if my European journey contributed ever so little to the cause Pf our nation it .is -above all due to the gracious influence of our Imperial house and also to the great power of our country—the Japanese empire.” French Regrets Saigon Scuffle Of Three Soldiers Injured Japanese Taken to Army Hospital for Care SAIGON.

He expressed his appreciation for the full and enthusiastic support of the press for -the fulfillment of his mission to Europe.

No sincere man can come in contact with Christ and still be able to leave without His influence. By attending the church services the influence of Christ is into the lives of the worshippers. Although this has been proclaimed by the Church, we find scientific evidences which supplement this fact. Not too long ago, two sociologists, Ernest W. Burgess and Leonard S. Cottrell, Jr., published their findings in their hook, \"Predicting Success or Failure in Marriage.” and among many things, they found that those who attended church until 19 years of age or over have better chances for happy marriage than those that did not. Likewise, Homell Hart's \"Chart for Happiness,” states the importance of church. Although many cannot agree with Dr. Link's reason for church at.tendance, we find him advising people to attend church in his \"Return to Religion” for psychological reasons. Christ gives us the abundant Way of Life. Whenever we meet in His name, we find Him in our midst, and His uplifting spirit enters into our midst, and makes our lives better because of it. —Rev.

Mr Chino, who works for Zen be i Horikoshi. silk importer* in the Merchandise Mart, was bowling along carefully in hi* i auto on the Outer drive at 43d st. when he found himself in- ; volved in an airplane accident. A yellow Taylor Cub plane swooped down In the rain, struck a lamp post on the park mg. and swung around into the drive, clouting hts car one. and giving him a bad few seconds. As be brought the auto to a i halt, he told police, two young men, one wearing a blue suit, and the other a tan Jacket and slacks, jumped out of the crack-ed-up plane and ran south. Then the police came, and as Lieut. William Granata of the park police questioned the be1 wildtred Chino, two youths, one 'wtfrihg g' blue silit and the BY K. HOFER . The problem of taxation today has there sides to It First, our tax rates must be adequate to product* necessary revenue. Second, the burden must be dls tributed so as to fall equitably on all classes of taxpayers (Third, we must not unnec«*ssar ily imperil our standard of living and our productive capacity by excessively burdening either industry or the individual [' One criticism of the new tax , bill is that it places far too great I a burden on the middle-income • groups — those who earn from $5,000 to 115.000 a year.

Sunday, June 22. 1911 No. 3 14)3 'Vantage Points RISING EMINENCE OF A RACE Last Wednesday evening, people all over the United States, men and women from all walks of life, listened to the dramatic broadcast of a scene enacted on a white canvassed arena. The principles were a young, much-publicized and willing Caucasian boy, the contender. He faced his foe, the title-holder, a Negro. The Negro won. His gentlemanly performance, it was voted, won the instant praise of the radio announcer, who noted that the audience on the scene immediately recognized the sportsman-like attitude of the title-holder in holding his prowess at bay while his less experienced, younger foe, gained his bearings on occasions during the fight. Born of a slave family, a Negro has risen to become one of the world’s greatest industrial chemist. His work has enabled the impoverished portions of the South, where formerly his ancestors worked as slaves, to realize wealth from products which he discovered could be made into a number of industrial substances by subjecting it to chemical processes. This farm crop was peanuts. A Negro theatrical artist has just played to a holdover packed house at the local Philharmonic auditorium. There rre Negro men and women singers who have reached the pinnacles of their careers. One of the highly praised Broadway production in New York is an adaptation from a prize novel written by a Negro. These are but isolated evidences of the steady rise of one of the races which corf prise our great American i democracy. Moreover, their rise is watched with avid interest and taken as an encouragement by other American racial groups. A RIGHTEOUS CONTENTION Some avid young followers of Japanese motion picturegijversed in the knowledge of the latest Robert Taylors and Ann Sheridans of the Nipponese screendom had a suggestion to make for whatever it is worth regarding the general run of the screen roles enacted by the child \"Stars in them. It was suggested that the dialogues spoken by most of them generally arc what might be called the “vulgar idiomatic expressions. was contended that they, the nisei, were taught differently and they had the impression that the more polite form of expression ought te be used in general conversations —especially by child* . ren. The nisei eiga fans, of course, had little comment to offer for the general run of the period films, pictures dealing with the settings in the historic past. The language used there, to the onlooker, was often archaic and not easily understandable anyway. A suggestion, then for whomever holds the post of censorship over these modern films from overseas.

Here's How To Save Your Tires Ten rules designed to “make tires last” in accord with the nation’s rubber conservation campaign today were released by Sheriff Eugene W. Biscalluz, chairman of the Los Angeles County Defense Council through th<j Council’s - public information coordinator, Randolph Van Nostrand. Urging motorists of the southland to co-operate religiously with the nation-wide campaign, Sheriff Biscailuz listed the ten rules as follows: 1. Have worn tires retreaded. Cost of retreading tires is usually about half that of a new tire, and will give about 80 per cent as much wear. 2. Reduce high speeds. Your tires will last twice as long at 40 miles per hour as at 60 miles an hour. 3. Inflate tires to recommended levels weekly. Never let pressure fall more than three pounds below recommended minimums. 4. Don’t stop short or make jackrabbit starts. Every time you ignore this rule you burn up the tread. 5. Avoid striking curbs, road holes, rocks, etc. These can resut in broken cords or blowouts. Drive slowly and carefully over paved roads. 6. Check wheel alignment twice a year. Misalignment , causes scufflog and uneven wear. A tire half inch out of line will be dragged sidewis.* 87 feet every mile. 7. Repair all cuts, leaks and breaks promptly. Delay may cause damage that can’t be repaired. Breaks and cuts should be vulcanized whenever possible; blowout patches should only be temporary. 8. Change wheel positions every 5,000 miles. 9. Always get the tire made to fit the rim of your car. 10. Don’t speed around turns. • FROST TAKES TOLL OF VALLEY CROPS EL CENTRO, Jan. 6—Re-cent low temperatures accom panied by heavy frosts have taken a serious toll of Imperial Valley’s winter vegetable crops, a survey conducted by B.

This is the subject matter which has come before many of the state legislatures and is now before Congress. There seems to be little dobut in our mind that the day is coming soon when socialized medicine will be a reality. And it is going to be a blessing to the poor class of people as well as to the white collar job workers who do not have enough to get good doctors or pay their bills promptly. The question of choice of doctors was raised as serious objections. It seems that as the debates go on, improvements are made. No matter what the defects are, there is no doubt that basically the program is something badly needed by the majority of the people of the country. The rich and those who can afford can continue to hire anyone they desire. And they can pay out of their own pockets. . The cry of regimentation was raised. But this seems to be a ■ather outmoded argument. On problems, such as old age pension, unemployment, and medical aid, it seems that the ebstplan is to make it compulsory. The big test of unemployment insurance is coming if the predicted layoffs should be severe during Git p'Hod *** reconversion. Defects may become apparent, but the payments are going to help many. The fear that medical progress would be retarded if socialized medicine should be installed appears to be unfounded. If millions of dollars can be collected from the people and part of it devoted to hiring scientists to continue their research, a greater number of new discoveries may be the result. The inventions would be public property and therefore the new medicines which may be produced would be i less expensive. The common people should actively campaign for the social security laws to include medi al | treatment. This seems to be the < sensible thing. The enactment of I such a law would mean another . progressive step forward. Any i flaws which may appear can be i changed. The important thing is < to have a good thing started. t RACE PREJUDICE A story was told to us recently s about a Nisei who was going to c leave an apartment house because l a Negro tenant was moving in. € This person had a sad experience s ASATO SOY BEAN * FOOD SHOP Call DELaware 1816 149 Division St. T.N.

The unfairness of sugfi generalization should be obvious to anyone who gives some thought to this question. But this is the common thinking of all who become imbued with race prejudice. For instance, the Nisei from Southern California, especially Los Angeles, are very anti-Semitic. They are very enthusiastic in damning the whole Jewish group because they have heard that the Jews capitalized on the evacuation and made money out of the Japanese. No one knows whether this is true or not. There may have been some but not to the exten as the reports indicate. The truth of the matter may be that a few individuals did have the cash to buy j up business and merchandise as well as household goods at dump- : ing {Rices. Everyone, including the gentiles and persons of Japanese ancestry, who had any spare cash may have bought things at bargain prices at the time of the evacuation. Simply because one Negro went wrong or because a few Jews speculated and made money at the time of the evacuation does not mean that everyone of that race or group is to be condemned. If the same line of reasoning should be followed, then all persons of Japanese ancestry are treacherous because of the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan. The Nisei are f irst to indignantly deny such a charge. We have been claiming right along that character is an individual thing. What one person does cannot !#; considered as a general trait of his family or of the whole race. In the Middle West, the East and more recently the West Coast, there is a strong undercurrent of antiNegro and anti-Semitic movement. Racists like Gerald K. Smith are stirring up the people. Living in such an environment means that there is a tendency to fall into the fallacious reasoning of generalization. The Nisei should be the champions of tolerance. They are the ones who have suffered the most from the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States. The mental anguish resulting from the mass evacuation from the West Coast should deeply impress upon them the unfairness of branding a whole group through the acts of some. If the Nisei are going to condemn the Negroes or the Jews because they had some unfortunate experience in the past or read about some such incidents, then MARK M. M'MIDA KIRI) GO.

Tomotsu Sakai, his sisters, Fusako and Shizu, and his mother and father were all busily engaged recently in painting and redocorating their store. Many old San Francisco and Topaz residents well recall the form Uoki Fish Company. Returnees here are anxiously awaiting the opening in order that they may again purchase some of the characteristic delicacies relished by them. Tomotsu’s wife, Chieko, has taken a position with the ILWU, Local 2, as a secretary. A CARD HOLDERS MAY GET TIRES WASHINGTON-Rubber Director John L. Collyer predicted today some A card holders may obtain new tires by next February or March, if present production goals are met'. New tiros have not been available to A curd holders since July, 1943. In a farewell press conference, Coliyt* '°id 35.Gfip.000 passenger car t Ires were schcu<N«i for production this year—or “little more than essentia! replacement roods.” Collyer based his estimate some A card holders will get new tires early next year on the expectation some 3,000,000 tires above essential needs will he available at the end of 1945 and the expected increased production in the early months of 1946. they have no defense to raise themselves. A minority group should be the first to understan dthe problems of another minority group. We have noticed in most instances that one group is not courageous enough and therefore will join the majority group. The same may be true with the Jews and Negroes against the Nisei. This is how minorities are split up so that they will not be able to unite for a common cause of tolerance and fair treatment. The Nisei should understand and have an over-al! picture of the problem. 日支御料理 ^3 鼓 VI ，— の御相談に鼸じ — す薄湖市西第一南街壷 # 四球 — 08 八 〇 一一あけ ^ の亭一一 4 系 . 一霣 N00? 2. 左一 317 一 - 〇 — I 炉まばこさつま 1) げスズゴ 9 簏斧ルメ廑物 II 魚 ：— クド魚 ④ 食料品大特價卜申し 1( す 1*1 ス米五 〇 〇 醬濰各種北京クドン 0 本クド〆ソバ腐乳乾羝乾海意ォボ 0 41 老極上 IV 佃煮 # ぬ ！！ 轉瀆紅生 1 赛茶日本某鈑見布 1) わび ！！ 諳ィ ^ 罐箱ィ ， の ！！ 辛 ：： キナ粉思昼小豆味ノ索籲齪各種まんぢぅ萑まめ ：：： 甘鎸豆ダィ耷生セゥガ 111 外練て II 擔へて唐らます口 # 萑子のマスタ 1 づけ # 梅干 # 白瓜の嫌づけソづけ等飾寶多 I 致します每 811 日も 31^ 鄱利用ドさいませユタ州鹽湖市 ， 丨ジ XV 卜衡百十番クエスタン魚庙電話國七八八八川煽 ^ 含 TOYO - KWAN 41 East 19th flt- Now York City, N, Y.

Ballif, acting relocation supervisor, War Relocation Authority. Frank G. Shelley, executive secretary, Utah State Farm Bureau, yesterday made public a letter sent to WRA authorities which condemned these regulations, urged modification and charged that the situation was resulting in “idleness” for \"hundreds of men and women willing to work” who now are being sup- ported by taxpayers in their idleness. The farm official attacked a ! WRA regulation which provided that evacuees can leave the camp I for any reason and may return at will, except when they leave to accept outside work. Because they lose their rights to return to the j camp, if they work, the Japanese ! are refusing work on farms in the ! Delta area, he said. “The reference made,” Mr. Ballif said, “to the prohibition of Japaese returning to the centers is misleading in that the Japanese can obtain short term leaves to investigate relocation possibilities or to attend to personal problems. “ , fh8M people may return to the center,” he continued. “The I length of time they can he away ; is limited. If and when they leave the center to accept employment, it is considered that i thev are able to relieve the govi ernment> *vf the responsibility of i feeding their families and therefore their privilege of reutrning • to the centers is restricted. , “The relocation process is now • reaching the total of 1000 people ■ per week from all the centers. This must be stepped up to from 3000 to 4000 per week from all centers i so that they can close on schedule.” The relocation center at Topaz is scheduled to close November L “In other words,” Mr. Ballif said, “the people in this center have three months’ time in which to locate a home in a community where they can live normal family lives.” The WRA official further pointed out that the mass exclusion order has been lifted and , that virtually all of these people are free to go where they wish , and obtain employment. “There are some people who SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH. MONDAY. JULY 23. 1945 D. MYER APPEALS TO RELOCATED EVACUEES TO HELP WASHINGTON, D. C.-Dillon S.| Myer, WRA Director, appealed to evacuees already reestablished in outside communities to help those still in centers, to relocate when he spoke before a group of relocatees in Cleveland, O., July 18. “WRA’s part of the job now is pretty much a matter of helping! people to help themselves,” the di-j rector stated. “Relocated evacuees j themselves must sell the ‘will to relocate’ to people still on pn>- j jects.” In pointing out the two principal ways in which resettled evacuees can help those at centers, Mr. My-' er declared: “WRA stands ready to assist in any possible way. But 1 say to you evacuees, not only to you, but to' all people who have left centers, j these are the ways in which you must help us meet these responsi-i bilities.” The first method of assistance Mr. Myer suggested was for re-j settled evacuees to exert a pull on' those in centers, convincing them' that they should resettle without further delay. Otherwise they may suffer unnecessary hardships later. Outsiders, the director said, can; emphasize that (1) employment J levels are now high, (2) the ap- ( ' proach of winter will complicate later relocation, and (3) early resettlers will get maximum attention in assistance with relocation and transportation problems. The director declared that relo- j catees already established could help with the adjustment of new-j [comer*. He urged cooperation in this line with the local Relocation office and with volunteer groups and individuals helping with resettlement problems. The director stressed assistance with housing, including the opening of their homes to new arrivals by earlier relocatees until the newcomers secure their own accommodations. Mr. Myer congratulated the Cleveland group on their cooperation so far in helping those more recently arrived from centers. He urged them to continue their relocation salesmanship, not as evacuees, but as Americans. “Your pioneering in resettlement has demonstrated not only your faitht in the American way, but has proved America’s faith in you,” the WRA director declared.

FttlIMJCA TO ESTABLISH HOSTEL I BUDDHIST TEMPLE h RESNO — Reverend Kakumin Fujinaga, who with his wife and baby returned from Gila recently, is now busy supervising work on the hostel being established in the Buddhist Temple. The family is now living in two rooms in the temple. Much progress has been made, with workmen cleaning and repairing the interior. Chief obstacle to c ompletion is the inability to identify all of the evacuee property stored in the temple, and to secure permission from the various owners for removal to a warehouse. Cooking and sleeping equipment for the hostel—cots, mattresses, blankets and kitchen utensils for 100 people—will be loaned by the WRA. It is hoped the hostel will be opened early in August.

W. Lessing, Chicago District Relocation Officer has announced. I A recent meeting at which a WRA staff member, Tats Kushida, formerly of Poston and Berkeley, Calif., talked to the Kiwanis Club of Oak Park, a prosperous suburban community, is described in the June 27 news bulletin of that club. “The Technicolor pictures and talks on the relocation of our Ja-panese-American citizens, Chicago’s newest minority, was most thrilling and interesting,’ states the Kiwanis Club Bulletin. “A program of this nature is good and very much in line with our Kiwanis tenets, which emphasize tolerance, understanding and good will.” “These Americans of Japanese ancestry are really a fine, energetic, progressive, and hard-working group of our people. We should understand them and from this understanding and acquaintance, we will learn to accept and admire them, with a banishment of distrust and suspicion on our part,” concludes the Bulletin. Mr. Kushida, who recently transferred from the Kansas City to the Chicago WRA office, has organized a group of volunteer Nisei speakers who will cooperate in this educational program and carry on, it is hoped, after the War Relocation Authority is liquidated, Mr. Lessing said. Nisei in Army IS umber 20,000 Reports WAR SAN FRANCISCO — At least 20,529 persons of Japanese ancestry are now in the armed forces of the United States, and Japanese Ar cncans have suffered more than 3,000 casualties in the European and Pacific theaters of war, K. B. Cozzens, assistant director of the War Relocation Authority, announced on July 6. The total number serving includes 20,298 enlisted and drafted. 153 officers and 78 WACs, the WRA reported. would have the government feed and care for 45000 people so they could enjoy the benefits of an excessive labor pool.

    "paragraphs": "\"Obtortatipn PcJt JIM CROWISM One wonders how an educated Negro can continue to live in the Deep South. And the fact that they have a better treatment elsewhere may be the main reason for the Negroes who migrated away from their homes during the war emergency deciding to remain where they had settled even after the defense jobs had come to an end. , Two lines of arguments nave been advanced on this question of Jim Crowism. One is that it is better for the Negroes to know where they stand for they will not expect more than what is being accorded them. For instance, in the Deep South, the Negroes know that they cannot eat with a white man in a public place. And in most states, they cannot be educated together. They cannot ride in public conveyances like equals by sitting in the same section. In many ways, either through laws or customs, the Negroes know what their rights are. The claim is made that the discrimination in the regions outside of the Deep South is more vicious because the Negroes expect equal treatment and are disappointed because they find Jim Crowism and other types of practices which deny them their rights. In many of the states outside of the Deep South, we find the Civil Rights laws which require nondiscrim inatory treatment of all in public places. Despite such laws, we find discriminations. However, it seems to us that once such rights are recognized by law, it merely is a matter of enforcement. This is easier to do in enlarging the restricted rights and freedom than to try to obtain equal treatment in a region where the law says that Jim Crowism must prevail. The white people from the Deep South are resentful of the way the Negroes are treated elsewhere. It is not uncommon to haer them say that once you give a Negro an inch, he will try to take advantage of everything. Expressions, such as, “We got to let them know their place,” is not unusual from those who come from the South. In most instances, the people have become accustomed to seeing the Negroes segregated so they accept the condition as a matter of fact. Most of the Southerners have not given any thought to the right or wrong of such treatment of fellow Americans. When a Southerner travels away from home, he is surprised to see Negroes eating in the same dining room or enjoying the same facilities at public places. Those who have not given any thought to this question seem to be amused to see this difference in the treatment of Negroes. Anyone will notice these things. For instance, in the Deep South, the railroad stations have separate waiting rooms. The Negroes have to fill the public busses from the rear and the whites from the front, and in some communities, intermingling at the center is permitted when the Negro or the white find room in the rear or front of the center point of the bus. In others, the sections are definitely set and there can be no intermingling one way or another. Californians, despite the poor record on racial questions, seem to | take the presence of minority groups in public places as a matter 'of fact. The Negroes had to fight (for their rights, such as against the labor unions, but they are enIjoying greater freedom than in the (Deep South. I All reports indicate that throughout the country, more and more people are becoming conscious of ! the evils of Jim Crowism. It may take many, many years but the jniillenium may come when the ideal 'of equality may become a reality in this country. It is not an impossibility. 'ASK INDEMNITY FOR NISEI !

Herald iTribune Salutes The 442nd (The following editorial saluting the famed 442nd Combat i Team was in the July 17th issue of the N. Y. Herald Tribune.) Wars, of course, are not over when the last shot is fired. In World War II intolerance and injustice to minority groups were being beaten down by the defeat of two of their great exponents, Germany and Japan. Today the battle goes on by education .cultural exchanges and, best of ail, daily examples of harmonious patterns of living. On Monday President Trun struck another blow in that ’cultural battle when he affixed the royal-blue Presidential Unit Citation banner to the battle standard 'of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. , The 442nd is composed of Nisei, second-generation Americans who are citizens and whose parents were Japanese immigrants. It fought in Italy, southern France and the Rhineland; was tagged “the Purple Heart Regiment” for its 3,600 citations, and received its Presidential .honors on the White House grounds. In the late winter and early spring of 1942, by contrast, and under duress of the emergency, more than one hundred thousand Japanese aliens and Nisei were removed from the Pacific Coast to the interior and placed in protective custody. Two1 thirds of this group was made up of American citizens, and in the region it had been obliged to quit there had been at times great feeling about the \"Yellow Peril,” which Pearl Harbor did nothing to lessen, j It has since been reported that campaigns in behalf of tolerance, some under the influence of the War Relocation Authority, some inspired by the 442nd and some by common sense, have done much to iron out unnecessary feelings of difference. If it had not happened this way there would not have been much point in the 442nd going overseas, or in any of the democratic theories that count men before race. We, too, salute the 442nd for its record overseas and the good work that record has accomplished here. Leather Scarce , Slate Production Cut Predicted Watch and Jewelry Repairing MAIN JEWELRY Prop.

Terrorish and killings have reached so high a peak a Japanese committee asked President Eurico Caspar Dutra for a statement declaring the war is over and Japan is defeated. The fanatics will not give up unless Hirohito or President Dutra issues feuch a proclamation. Brazilians recommended that General Douglas MacArthur be acquainted with what has been happening here and asked to induce Hirohito to send a message through the State Department and the Foreign Ministry here. Detectives Engage Unintentionally In Agers’’ Game • MINNEAPOLIS - Detectives Mike Michelson and Donald Trovie sped to a vacant lot after neighbors called the police and reported suspicious characters had been seen burying something. The officers dug up several cans filled with small toys, candy and rubber balloons which they took to the station, and returned to the lot to await developments. | Two ‘teen agers approached and asked the detectives if they had seen anyone digging in the lot. The boys said, “We’re having a treasure hunt and somebody has stolen all the prizes.” The detectives returned to the lot —at night—got out their shovels and reburied the prizes.—The Associated Press. NEW YORK. - The National Shoe Manufacturers’ Association said recently that practically the entire shoe industry will be forced to close down unless OPA acts quickly to adjust the price of hides. I “Tanners cannot get hides and manufacturers are not getting any leather,” an association spokesman said. “If we don’t get relief immediately August production may be curtailed as much as 90 per cent.” During the period when OPA was inoperative, hide prices advanced from 15’-2 cents a pound to 21 or 22 cents a pound, but now have been rolled back to the former ceiling price. 鳴靠 DR.

S. Evacuees Told Canadian Group VANCOUVER, B. C.-Evacuees of Japanese ancestry can be returned to coastal areas peaceably “if common sense is used,” Elmer R. Smith, assistant professor in anthropology at the University of Utah, told the intercultural relations workshop of the University of British Columbia on July 25. He told the Canadian audience that young Americans of Japanese ancestry who have returned to i home on the West Coast are reassimilating successfully in spite of initial acts of violence against them and are leading intercultural ' friendship groups in their former > communities. , Prof. Smith asserted that Japa- ‘ nese Americans displayed “great 'courage” in returning to their former communities on the West Coast, as well as in making their ■ way in other parts of the country against distrust and fear on the part of white Americans, after ■ themselves experiencing “mixed emotions of fear, frustration and ’ anger” in war relocation centers. — ! Pacific Citizen. Car Production ! In August May | Exceed 125,000 DETROIT — Passenger automobile production in the United States ■ next month probably will exceed ‘ 1 125,000 units.

The factories topped the (500,000 mark in four months of 1 1941, but did not exceed 450,000 in any month in the latter half of that year, the Associated Press reports. 0 Office: 706 Utah Sav. & Tr.

I Speaking informally, he said that the Department of Interior was interested in following through with what happens to Japanese Americans with the end of the WRA on June 30th. “The Resettlement Study is a one year project from July 1946 to July 1947 in three major areas: the West Coast, Chicago, and Denver. On the West Coast, the three centers of study will be Los Angeles, Seattle, and Port- ; land. j DeYoung said the study plans to maintain a staff in Washington and have research men in the field. Mr. Toshio Yatsushiro will be working with him in the Chicago study. It will be their problem to find out what is going to happen and make recommendations. Because the study is under the sponsorship of a government agency and will be a scientific one, DeY’oung believes that their recommendations would carry some weight . Mr. DeYoung added that any questions about resettlement and the clearance of WRA unfinished business could be referred to the War Agency Liquidation Unit, Mr. B. Larsen, Department of Interior, Washington, D. C. Wolf Whistle Denounced As Cowardly Act CAMP KILMER (N.J.)-Whis-tling atw omen is “low, cheap, cowand moronic,” say Chaplain Albinus R. Lesch. Writing in the Kilmer Eagle, camp newspaper, he said today that such a method to “greet” a woman “is an attempt to reduce the grandeur and nobility of womankind to the level of the female animal.” “It is a cowardly act,” he continued, “because the whistler openly discards his role as protector of women and deliberately takes advantage of his superior strength.” > SHO FU-DO > 145 West 2nd South .

The important thing that must be kept in mind by all persons of Japanese ancestry is the fact that if we expect eual treatment, we must practice it ourselves. Despite the United States Supreme Court decisions regarding the constitutionalitv of the orders in the curfew and evacuation matters, everyone of us believes that racial prejudice and not military necessity was the dominating factor as far as General John L. DeWitt was concerned. Thus all of us belie'e that we were the victims of a vicious racist mind which was warped in its judgment with the idea that citizenship is a mere scrap of \"The evacuation has taught us how damaging race prejudice can be. It has destroyed the structure that had taken over fifty years to build. The pride which the Japanese people had in keeping off the relief rolls has vanished. Juvenile delinquency undoubtedly will increase. The economic foundations of a large number has been destroyed and they have been relegated to the ranks of workers and not independent operators. A youth may have the courage and the energy to start again but this is not the* case with the elderly Issei. His spirit is there. But the flesh will not respond. The lesson we should have learned from the evacuation is tolerance. The experiences we have undergone would have been many times harder to endure if we did not have friends on the outside, risking evervthing to be fair.

Every group has the bad and good individuals. To be < condemned because one person may 1 go wrong is unfair. In the same manner, to think all Japanese are 1 good because one person did a good deed is misleading. We have wanted each individual to be judged separately. In the same manner, we should not judge the Negroes, Jews, Chinese or others as a group. If we have learned this lesson, we will not become race-baiters ourselves like many Nisei from Southern California are. . . Many of our Caucasian friends who have been fighting our cause have been doing so purelv from the standpoint of justice and fair play. They are the ones who were the strongest. Those who stood by us because of our long acquaintances were few compared to those liberals who came forth to battle the racists. Our friends were willing to fight for us individually but not for the ideals of tolerance. And it has been the biggest surprise for the liberals to hear the frank confessions of the Nisei that there is a strong anti-Semitic feeling, a prejudice against the Negroes and so forth. They are amazed that persons of Japanese ancestry \\\\ho should be the champions of tolerance todav because of the sufferings they had to undergo because of discrimination have not developed sufficient character, strength and understanding to withstand the pressue of the majority when another minority is involved. We would like to see the dav come when the Nisei will be glad to walk off their jobs when strikes are on. We would like to see the Nisei champion the cause of the minorities, whether it be for the Negro or the Jew. We bolie\\e the Nisei should know that the very arguments being used about losing business if Negroes come or if the colored man comes to live next door is being used against them. It is the same line of talk used against every minority. A casual glance at the restrictive covenants should awaken the Nisei to the realization that prejudice and discrimination should be the last thing he should practice or countenance. If persons of Japanese ancestry have not learned anything from their tragic wartime treatment, they w ill be maneuvered into a position where they will not be able to ask for fair treatment because they do not accord such treatment to other minorities. It is easy to ride the tide with the majority, but such a group can easily turn, against us. We know from expe-1 日支御料埋餞 12 271 タ ー 〇 舞相找に一 ! じます鹽繁西第 1 南择轚查四却 —^ 〇 二あけ ^ の亭 114 ヂ ー 攀一 N009 泽篆鱗 0141.

OCTOBER 24. 1945 February 1 Set As Date For Closing Tule Lake WASHINGTON — The War Re-! location Authority announced to-j day the Tule Lakes Segregation Center in Northern California will be closed February 1st. The center is one of 10 established in 1941 to accommodate the people of Japanese ancestry evacuated from the Pacific Coast. Two of the centers, Jerome in Arkansas and Granada in Colorado, already have been closed. All the others except Tule Lake will be closed by December loth. During the remaining months of operation at Tule Lake, the WRA will continue to assist in the relocation of those residents eligible to leave. Those being detained under justice department jurisdiction will remain in custody until final disposition of their cases. 1.245 Babies Arrived In Segregation Center > TULE LAKE SEGREGATION CENTER (Modoc Co.)—Half the > 16,<MM> “dangerous” Japanese held here behind barbed wire for three iind a half years were free to leave t<*day, but they are staying and having babies.

Border patrolmen of *! the immigration and naturalization 11 esrvice guard the enclosure. Through August 1, 1,245 babies ■ I were born to tnc prolific Japanese t behind barbed wire here. The gov- • ernment foots the hospital and doctor bills. The 1945 birth rate through August was 32 babies per 1,000 popu- • lation. The national 1940 birth ‘ rate was 17.9 per 1,000. Japanese ! doctors attending births receive 819 1 a month, plus keep. ■j The Tule Lake Japanese were culled from the Pacific Coast defense zone early in 19-42 as “dangerous to military security” under the direction of Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, an apostle of the -a Jap is still a Jap” theory. The rest were sent to nine other camps —all'of which have been ordered closed by December 15th. Roy It. Best, War Relocation Authority project director, gave some of the reasons for reluctance of be* tween 7,000 and 8,000 Japanese who could walk out of the enclosure right now, to leave. •‘Some have no money and no job, no friends outside to help them get a fresh start. Some are better off here than they ever were outside. The department of justice will decide what to do with those who renounced their citizenship. The center was stunned by the end of the war.” Old men sit and talk, grow potted plants, and make trinkets from shell found on the ground, for the center is located on a dry lake bed. Thousands who could leave, officials said, have been held back by fear of threats voiced in Pacific Coast states, the inertia born of three and a half years* confinement, lost hope, and to some the achievement of a kind of ‘‘social security.” Except for the “stop list,” of 4,505, the others are permitted to go shopping in nearby Klamath Falls. No hostile incidents have occurred, and those venturing forth return to the fold at night to tell what they saw in the city. It has cost the government some 824,528,000 to be host to the Japanese held here. Tule Lake is only one of 10 such centers to which Pacific Coast Japanese were sent in the Spring of 1942. Although nearly half of the 16,000 here are free -to leave, they stay on at a costt, according to War Relocation Authority figures, of 819,200 a day (81.20 per person), 87,008.00 per year—roughly 824,528,000 for three and a half years.

The WRA operated camp newspaper, in an apparent editorial campaign to coax the free boarders to leave( relates stories of opportunities awaiting them in the outside world. But many Pacific Coast communities and organizations have announced publicly they want no part of the Tule Lakers. The result 1 has been that only half the Japanese leaving the centers have gone back to the coast. The others have gone East. WRA officials said only a few of those who renounced United States citizenship want to go to Japan. They pointed to cases in which an alien Japanese father had believed he would be deported, so I he prevailed on his children to reI nounce United States citizenship so the family could stay together. | Last September 5th the army I lifted individual exclusion orders on many aliens. This forces the children who renounced citizenship to stay here while, ironically, the father is free to go.

    "paragraphs": "OltAertaticH PcAt NEGRO-JAPANESE RELATIONSHIP A Los Angeles Negro weekly, Los Angeles Tribune, contained an editorial which stated, “JapaneseNegro relations do stink.” Some of the frank statements were: “Even if we are wrong in assuming that the lack of cordiality we have noted in Japanese, more especially the men, in business dealings, springs from a reservoir of contempt for the Negro, the fact remains that there is altogether too little unified action by Japanese and Negroes to achieve the ends which they both have in common . . . “The fact that the Japanese hasn’t been taken to the Negro’s bosom is his own fault. It has been proffered in countless ways. In the beginning, there were the efforts to hire the evacuees, in so many instances efforts which were determinedly resisted. There were attempts to integrate Japanese into Negro organizations of protest and of counteraction to prejudice. Excepting an instance or so, these too were met by indifference . . . “The Japanese is appalled by the Negroes’ violent reaction to frustration because he, the Japanese, not yet acclimated, had not yet hoped for too much and is, consequently, not so very frustrated. While the Negro, long acclimated, not only insist on hoping, but insist on demanding, and continually rams his head against a granite wall . . .” That there could be a closer cooperation between the two groups cannot be denied. But it is a difficult objective because of the fact that both are minorities. As we have so often reiterated, if all who consider themselves minorities are sympathetic with each other, they will become a majority and there will be no discrimination which can hurt to any great extent. There are amongst the Negroes who have the same feeling as the race mongers of the West Coast towards Japanese Americans. They are the new arrivals who have been indoctrinated by the propaganda and who have no background of the problem. They did not see the tragic evacuation. Those who lived in California saw what transpired and it was not difficult for them to place themselves in the position of the Japanese who were being sent away from their homes. Because of the economic clash and the competition for housing in the same crowded L’il Tokyo, it would not have been surprising to have had violences. It is to the credit of the Negroes and Japanese that relationship has been harmonious as it has been. The editorial sounds the tone of a cynic because actually the situation does not “stink”. It could be better we admit but it has been the surprise of all that the two groups have been adjusting themselves to each other. We would like all persons of Japanese ancestry to be sympathetic to all minority problems. After the experiences of the evacuation, this should be the logical and natural thinking. However, we regret to state that it is not so. Anti-Semitic feeling is strong amongst the Los Angelites because there was the unfounded and unconfirmed rumors at the time of the evacuation that the Jews exploited the situation. The fear of the majority opinion makes many join the anti-Negro thinking. In other words, the character of the Nisei in particular has not been molded into liberalism. He is just as much a coward as the general public which seeks protection in the majority bows to prejudice. Rather than contempt, we believe it is a matter of indifference. This would be the inevitable conclusion when we see the large majority of evacuees indifferent towards the promotion of their own welfare. If they cannot fight for themselves, how can anyone expect them to give any thought to the problems of others. The editorial writer of the Negro paper may be able to soothe his feelings by deliberating on the make-up of the Nisei mentality to a greater degree. Then he may not be “hypersensitive.” JACL CARNIVAL PRIZE CONTRIBUTORS The Salt Lake JACL wishes to acknowledge with grateful appreciation the following contributors: Queen’s Cup Henry Y.

A man reported two girls carrying guns tried to rob him but he fled. The police said that although women ganged together to beat and rob, this was the first recorded time any had resorted to firearms here. The police arrested two deaf and dumb youths and charged them with 10 burglaries and six pocket pickings netting an estimated 100,000 yen ($6,667). t The topper involved the Kyoto police chief and his assistant, who came here to learn more about police work. While the chief and his aide enjoyed a bath, someone stole their clothing, wrist watches and cash. They had to borrow clothing for the trip home the Associated Press reported. Attention, Girls!

It also disclosed it is developing what will be called an “Airgram,” a postwar version of V-mail except that the letter will not be photographed. The “Airgram,” will be a lightweight, stamped envelope with space on the back for writing. When finally approved by the department, it can be mailed anywhere in the world for 10 cents. Gael Sullivan, Second Assistant Postmaster General in charge of all mail transportation, said the new regular air mail rates will be officially announced during Air Mail week which begins Nov. 1. Sullivan said a uniform rate for each continent will replace the present rate schedules which vary for each country. For example, there are now 17 different rates to South America. The new rates per half-ounce will be: To South America, 10 cents; to Europe, 15 cents; to South Africa, 25 cents; and to Asia and Australia, 25 cents. North Africa will receive the European rate. Here are some examples of the projected slashes: To Stockholm, from 30 to 15 cents a half ounce; to Cairo, from 70 to 15 cents; to Buenos Aires, from 20 to 10 cents; to Auckland, N. Z., from 50 to 25 cents; to Shanghai, from 70 to 25 cents. Sullivan said reciprocal reductions will not be made immediately by foreign countries on mail destined for this country. But he said the heads of foreign postal administrations contacted during a round-the-world flight in August unanimously favored a reduction in international air mail rates. Sullivan predicted the new rates will increase international air mail “to fantastic proportions.” He added: . “Any increase in international air mail will ractically come under the head of new business. We’re not getting any business out of the present high rates. For example, when Postmaster Hannogan and I were in Cairo one day last month, exactly seven letters arrived from the United States, the Associated Press reported.

The church membership is comprised of 75 per cent Negro, 7 per cent Japanese-Amcrican and 18 per cent Caucasian. This church has been credited with having done much toward relieving racial tension in the Oakland community. About three years ago Rev. Robert R. Johnson, a Negro clergyman, was appointed associate minister of the church and for the first time a Negro clergyman and a white pastor was teamed up. Rev. William N. Lovell, who became head of this church in 1943, when it was all white, says: \"This church became inter-racial in its membership in natural adjustment to the character of its neighborhood. The first important change in the church’s racial make-up was in 1944 when a large part of the Japanese-Americaos who settled in this neighborhood, became active in the church. Encouraged by the welcome given the nisei, one or two Negroes began to attend church services. Gradually their number increased. especially after a Negro girl was recruited for the choir. Since the spring of l94o there has been a steady increase in the number of Negroes. At a meeting of the general membership the congregation voted to \"reaffirm\" the Congregational-Christian policy of having it* fellowship open to all persons regardless of race or color.

The three, Seiji Izumi, Yutero Kogure and Tetsuji Nishigori, were selected by the Japanese government with approval of the American military government in Japan. They have just completed a 22week course at the Civil Aeronautics center at Oklahoma City. They will be stationed in the air route traffic center and the airport traffic control tower, working with CAA employees there to complete their training. A group of Salt Lake Japanese Americans met their plane, and have planned hospitality for them during their stay. Mr. Nishigori is leader of the group, according to Harold C. Howard, chief of the air rout traffic control center, who announced coming of the three men.

Hawaii Statehood Gets Favorable Committee Report WASHINGTON—The Senate Interior and Insular Affairs committee has favorably reported out a bill to give Hawaii statehood, an action which prompted the hope of Mike Masaoka, national J ACL ADC legislative director, that “this deserving territory will get the statehood it has merited for so long.” Mr. Masaoka pointed out the strategy of statehood proponents is to seek Senate approval first, rather than House approval, tried last session. Last year, statehood died in the Senate. Mr. Masaoka said: “It is our hope that the Senate will see fit to grant statehood to Hawaii. The islands want statehood, deserve it, and we who feel as they do are doing what we can to stimulate Senate approval of their bill.” Japanese Marrying Younger TOKYO —Japanese are marrying younger than ever before. A survey by the welfare ministry shows that one out of every five girls married was under 20 years' of age. Fifteen years ago less than one in ten was that young.

SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MONDAY, APRIL 9, 1951 Masaoka Confers on Evacuation Claims WASHINGTON—Mike Masaoka, national JACL ADC legislative director, returned to Washington from a trip to Los Angeles to begin a round of conferences with Govvernment officials seeking some method of speeding up the evacuation claims program. In a conference with James E. Nugent, a member of the investigators’ staff with the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Masaoka submitted a detailed brief on shortcomings of the claims payment set-up. Later, he reviewed the program with members of the staff of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on appropriations for the Department of Justice. He urged the Subcommittee to increase administrative appropriations and “untie the hands of the claims program.” He also met with Department of Justice officials and reviewed talks he had in Los Angeles with John Allen, attorney in charge of the Los Angeles field office for the Department, and with members of the Los Angeles Subcommittee of the JACL evacuation claims section. “Go For Broke\" World Premiere Set for Honolulu HONOLULU —Honolulu has been selected for the world premiere of “Go For Broke!” MGM film on the story of the 442nd regimental combat team.

Makers Report NEW YORK —Toy guns, tanks, jet planes, walkie-talkies and bathtub navies are in bigger demand these days as children’s play- : —r — Japan Eager tor'Peace Pact, Visitor LOS ANGELES — “Japan is eager for a formal peace treaty, for only with freedom can she achieve self-sufficiency.” Speaking through an interpreter, Kotaro Mori, a member of the Japanese Diet and former Minister of Nippon Agriculture and Forestry, thus described his country’s current feeling under American ocupation. With two other members of the Diet—Ryoji Inoue and Railo Mat-suno—he was a guest Tuesday of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. The three Japanese are among 10 Diet members touring the United States as the Japanese Congressional Agricultural Mission to study agricultural methods and legislative procedures here with a view toward revising Japan’s farm policy. “We now receive aid from America and other allied countries,” Mori said, “but we realize this cannot and should not continue indefinitely, both because of the burden on taxpayers who are helping us and for the good of Japan’s future,” With her land limited—especially in view of overseas territories lost in the war —Japan’s main problems are population and food, Mori explained. Nippon has been unable to expand her food production fast enough to take care of her population. Mori added his country must incease managerial efficiencies, light trades production and foreign sales with which to import raw materials and food supplies to augment Japan’s output. things, the toy manufacturers of the U.S.A, said today. “Miniatures of .military equipment have reappeared in some volume for the first time since 1946, reflecting juvenile interest in defense preparations,” the manufacturers said in announcing plans for their 1951 new toy display opening. But, they added, cowboy regalia holds the No. 1 spot.

The amendment would permit GIs to serve in segregated units “if they wish.” Mike Masaoka, national JACL ADC legislative director, said the proposal was a “rank excuse for discrimination.” He said Rep. Chet Holifield, (D., Calif.), has been fighting vigorously to defeat the amendment, and lauded him for his efforts. At the same time he warned there was a possibility the case of the 442nd Regimental Combat team, the all-Nisei outfit, would be exemplified as to “how good a segregated outfit could be.” “The 442nd fought courageously,” Mr. Masaoka said, “but it was not fighting for the right to be segregated. It was fighting for the right of its people at home to win acceptance among all Americans. “It would be unfair and misleading if the case of the 442nd were to be held up as an example of what good can be accomplished by ‘voluntary’ segregation. “Segregation in the armed forces is a luxury that costs American lives —white, Negro, Nisei, or others. If a rifle company needs replacements, the enemy doesn’t care what color the skin of the man is who moves up to fill a hole. They don’t want anyone there. At the same time, Mr. Masaoka said the JACL ADC has gone on record in support of another amendment, which will be offered shortly to protect personnel in uniform against intimidation and violence by civilians. Such regulations now protect, for example, Internal Revenue Men, against the threat of violence and bodily harm. Mr. Masaoka asserted\" such a law would help protect, for example the Negro soldier, especially in Five Cents Hearings on Omnibus Bills Reopen Today WASHINGTON—Final hearings on omnibus immigration and naturalization bills will be resumed by a joint Senate-House Subcommittee Monday, according to the JACL ADC. Originally scheduled to conclude public hearings March 23, the Joint Subcommittee recessed until April 9 in order to question the Immigration and Nationality Lawers Association about a brief they have prepared analyzing the omnibus bill introduced by Sen. Pat McCarran, (D., Nev.). The Association’s report is frankly hostile towards the McCarran bill, but does not cover the other two omnibus bills before the joint committee — introduced by Reps. Francis E. Walter, (D., Penn.), and Emanuel Celler, (D., N.Y.). The final hearings are expected to last but one day. All three omnibus bills have certain features in common. They all would eliminate racial discrimination in both immigration and naturalization. The provisions of the bills granting quota immigration to all Asian countries, including Japan, and removing race as a requirement in naturalization laws are patterned after similar provision in the Judd bill, first introduced at the request of the JACL Anti-Discrimin-ation Committee. Both Senate and House Subcommittee members have indicated that some changes will be made in the present omnibus bills before they are finally reported out of committe for floor debate. some areas of the South, or the Mexican American in uniform from intimidation in certain areas of the Southwest. He recalled that during the last war it was not unusual for the first year or so after Nisei donned uniforms, to find them threatened by certain irresponsible individuals on the coast. Later, after they began coming back from combat as heroes, the situation was quite different, he said. WEST TEMPLE PHARMACY 80 West 2nd So.

Y.. Dee. 9 (U.R) — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky sailed for home today declaring that the United Nations general assembly \"as an instrument for peace is not satisfactory.” Vishinsky sailed for Le Havre with 13 Russian colleagues aboard the French liner Liberte. He and two top aides sailed first class, nine others had secorid class bookings and two were in tourist class. Although Vishinsky customarily leaves the annual assembly sessions at approximately this time, his departure now was taken as foreshadowing a flat, official rejection of the U. N.’s Korean peace plan by the Chinese Communists and North Koreans. Vishinsky’s farewell statement, delivered in Russian, did nothing to dispel this impression. Says U. N. Inadequate “Of course,” said Vishinsky, “I want to talk about the U. N. general assembly. Although It has not finished yet, it does not fulfill its duty In the struggle for peace. “The very fact that the general assembly adopted a resolution (on the Korean war) cannot be construed as working for peace. It shows that the general assembly of the U. N. as an Instrument for peace is not satisfactory. “The U. N. was created for peace. It should be like that and it must be like that. Unfortunately, the U. N. is far from being an instrument for peace. “The Soviet delegation has done all possible to strengthen the U. N. ana will contlnuA to strengthen the U.

At the same time the incoming President worked overtime with ten men of his brain trust to develop a plan of his own for Korea and for a comprehensive foreign policy that probably will be the framework for the action of the trta world during the coming years. *- The President-elect worked behind locked doors In thb admiral's cabin all day and late into thq night as the Helena plunged steadily toward Pearl Harbor from Guam. It was stated that Eisenhower has not yet been given the details of the plan MacArthur said he has for Korea, but that the President-, elect wants to know what .it is. so that he can Incorporate part or all of It in his own master plan for Korea. j Cool to Each Other’ The two generals have been cool to each other since World War II when they held parallel commands in Europe and the Pacific. Before the war Eisenhower served direct-< ly under MacArthur as aide when MacArthur was chief at staff fix This coolness became more acute this year when MacArthur supported Sen. Robert Taft for the BepubuttiB’ pfetaawtitirt nuuif—Maa -r th?n failed to hit a fitter to brig ] Elsenhower spoke publicly of MacArthur in respectful, if not warm, words. At Abilene, Kans.. Eisenhower said no orie could serve some respect for his standing as a military man,” How far the two generals can go to heal their breach is unknown now, but the source close to Elsenhower said either tho Presidentelect himself or a representative will ask MacArthur for details of the plan he says he has. By MERRIMAN - 5MITH ABOARD USS HELENA, Dec. 9 (U.R)—President-elect Eisenhower and his top advisers held secret \"flag room” conferences today on how to cope with the Korean crisis. From Washington came word that Republican senators would urge Eisenhower to invite Gen. Douglas MacArthur to submit his “clear and definite solution\" to the Korean war. MacArthur’s plan has not been submitted to Elsenhower, but it was regarded among those aboard this cruiser as highly unlikely that the President-elect would decline to get the benefit of advice from the former supreme commander in the Far East. The Washington report quoted Sen. Herman Welker (R-Ida.) as saying Eisenhower and MacArthur possess “the two greatest military minds in the world today.” Eisenhower’s press secretary, James C. .Hagerty, refused to give any information about the talks to curious newsmen aboard this 17,000ton cruiser and the men who have been designated cabinet members shunned questioners. Conference Began Yesterday The conference, still In a conversational phase, began yesterday when John Foster Dulles, Elsenhower’s choice for secretary of state, stepped from a helicopter to th? deck of the cruiser. He was followed by Elsenhower’s chosen Treasury Secretary George Humphrey. Interior Secretary Douglas McKay and Attorney General Herbert Brownell. They deprived themselves of an opportunity to enjoy balmy weather all day yesterday by remaining with Eisenhower In the flag room and talking about ways to end the Korean stalemate without causing * major war. ' Though Hagerty was uncommunicative. there were indications that Eisenhower was blueprinting aoma of the messages and speeches on foreign affairs he will give ToUoWIng his Jan,. 20 inauguration. The talks with thd cabinet members were kept in a hueh-hukh category by Eisenhower . for twd important reasons. ■ ■ - l i; Elsenhower does not want to > issue any statements on pubUO policy until he becomes President, i at which time he will be able to back what he says with action. 2. This is just a preliminary to i another phase of the conference I which will start when the Helena : reaches Pearl Harbor at 2 pm. EST Thursday .

Morhia Cemetery to prove that he was shot in the forehead. A. Connor of Middleton, Wis., claims, it was Jesse James who fired the fatal shot. “I understand that due to the mineral content of the soil at Deadwood,” Connor wrote the Chamber of Commerce, “there is an excellent chance of Hickok’s skull being intact. In that case one look at the bullet hole will prove or disprove the seemingly fantastic statements I have made . . .** But Deadwood historians don’t think Hickok’s bones should be disturbed. Jack McCall admitted, and was hanged, for shooting Wild BUI in the back of the head as he played poker in the No. 10 saloon in Deadwood in 1876. Foreign Legion In Casablanca To Keep Peace CASABLANCA.

Transportation moved normally. The latest count on the rioting showed eight Europeans killed and seven wounded while ten policemen were slain and ten wounded. Among the rioters the toll was 40 dead, 260 Injured. Of the injured. 60 required hospitalization and nine are near death. Another 140 rioters were under arrest, including three leaders of the Moroccan independence movement. (The Paris newspaper. Paris Pfesse, said that 300 persons, including 12 leaders were arrested. The leaders were said to be eight union officials and four heads of the Istiqlal Nationalist party.

Governor Oren E. Long doesn’t expect to return from the Western governors’ conference to greet Eisenhower here. Governor Long plans to leave for Washington, D. C., shortly.

Cuts Through Concrete-Tile Cowie said the 1,200 pound propeller sheared through a comer of the concrete-tile home and partially buried Itself in the ground. Neighbors said a large dust cloud rose from the shatterd concrete,' causing them to believe the house was on fire. t Sheriff's deputies immediately threw a tight guard around the house and newsmen and photographers were prevented from entering the area or talking to its occupants for nearly 14 hours. Deputy. Sheriff Arthur Cross said the action was taken on orders from Castle Base officials. The deputies later were relieved by a plane load of armed guards from Castle who were ordered by Air Force officials “to keep people away from the propeller” until an investigation could be made. “Apparently our military police thought they were guarding a super-duper secret weapon.” Castle field public relations officer Capt. James A. Carmichael explained. “There was no conceivable reason for the secrecy apparently enforced in this instance.” Cowie, a real estate man, could offer no explanation for the action taken by the guards in holding his family ’ “virtual prisoners” pending an investigation.

Supreme Court WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 (D.B — A Negro attorney opened historic arguments before the Supreme' ■ ■ fqrces Negro children into “an inferior caste.\" Bv CHARLOTTE G. MOULTON WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 (UP) — The Supreme Court takes up one of the most explosive issues in American life today at a historic hearing on the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. Two famed attorneys, one Negro and one white, are pitted against each other in the courtroom drama which climaxes.a 30-year legal fight by Negro groups. Before the high tribunal are five separate cases, all raising the same question: Does the mere fact of segregation put the stamp of inequality on Negro students, even if they are provided school facilities as good as those provided for white children? The oral arguments beginning at 1:30 p.m. EST will run into tomorrow and perhaps Thursday. On the court's decision — which may not come for several weeks — depends the continuance of the South's timehonored doctrine of “separate but equal” educational systems for the two races. .

S. May Withdraw Some Security Troops From Japan By HERBERT GORDON (International News Service Staff Correspondent) WASHINGTON Dec. 9 (IMS)—An authoritative source said today the United States Is planning to withdraw spme security troops from Japan “before the end of next year.\" He said any such troop withdrawal probably would begin on Hokkaido—-within sight of Russian occupied islands. The source Insisted that top American military leaders in Japan al- ready have discussed tms reaucwon with highest Japanese government officials. He said the reduction of military protection by the United States Is not designed to leave Japan with less defensive strength than is now provided through both its own police reserves and American assistance. Rather It Is hoped that Japan, through a proposed multl-milllon dollar economic and military aid program from the United States will reach the state where it can enlarge its own defensive forces to fill the resultant partial vacuum of strength. Presumably, reduction of U. S. security forces Would be largely In the shape of ground troops, the one type of military strength Japan Is in the best position to replace. This would not be coupled with any anticipated reduction in air or naval assistance to Japan. The plans to reduce some U. S. manpower In Japan apparently Is not contingent upon the fighting in Korea, although it is understood in Washington that a major offensive campaign by either the U.N. or th< Communists could temporarily delai plans to cut U.S. strength In Japan On the other hand, the UJS. nov seems to be shaping up a plan o: reducing strength regardless of J a. pan’s own state of military prepared ness but there is an intense hopi Tokyo will recognize the bltte: reality of what military weaknes means to the Communists and re double efforts to find some metho< of enlarging its own defense system This, of course, raises the urgen question of whether the propose: plan to reduce security forces ma; not require the Japanese to begii giving serious consideration to plan for revising their constitution. Observers feel tiat once Japan 1 faced, not with the theoretics argument of whether militar strength, per se, is good or evil, bu the cold reality of defensive weak ness within sight and sound of Rus sian-occupied islands, the Japanes will insist on adequate defenslv home forces.

ACHIEVEMENTS LISTED I Here’s a list of some of the I achievements of the official Ha- ■ waii statehood delegation, which , represented a true cross-section of [ the heterogeneous but homogene- I ous end loyal population of Ha- | waii including the top men in the i Territorial executive (Governor j King), in the legislative (Senate President Wilfred C. Tsukiyama and House Speaker Hirajn L. Fong) and in the judicial branches (Chief Justice Edward A. Towse of the Territorial Supreme Court and Honolulu Circuit Court Judge Calvin C. McGregor): 1. They contacted the leaders of the executive branch of the U.S. government — an audience with President Dwight David Eisenhower in the White House, a 30minute conversation with Vice President Richard M. Nixon, who is also president of the 96-member US. Senate; and calls on Acting Interior Secretary Ralph A. Tudor and Director William C. Strand of the Office of Territories ot the U S. department of interior. 2. They made key contacts with the leaders of the legislative branch of the Federal government — with Senate Majority Floor Leaded- William F. Knowland, Chairman Hugh Butler of the Senate committee on interior and insular affairs, Chairman Homer Ferguson of the Senate Republican policy committee, Senator John J. Sparkman of Alabama, 1952 Democratic vice presidential nominee; Senator Pat McCarran of Nevada, co-author of the 1952 Waite r-McCarran immigration and nationality act; Senator Russell B.

The Soviet Union gave an ambiguous reply at the first secret session of the nine-nation Indo- • China peace conference, but one authoritative source said “some progress” had been made, leaving the door open for a second restricted meeting tomorrow. HANOI, Indo-China, May 17 (U.R) —France tonight broadcast to the Indo-Chinese Viet Minh Communists a “last chance” ultimatum to live up to a mercy truce for evacuation of French \"Union wounded from Dien Bien Phu. The alternative. France warned, is all-out air attack by every plane France can muster in Indo-China on Red troops and material reported moving down highway No. 41 from Dien Bien Phu to the Hanoi area. France angrily charged the Communists were using the “mercy truce” to move men and arms up to the Red River Delta for a new Red assault on Hanoi itself. The Reds had ignored the earlier French ultimatum and instead blamed France for collapse of the mercy evacuation. The delta, itself, already is unr 4er heavy Communist pressure with Attacks in battalion force carrying to outposts within six miles of the capital. In the latest action, an outnumbered unit of French and native taeops were etMMhng off an encircling ring of Reds at Anxa, a stronghold 52 miles southeast of Hanoi. Supreme Court Ruling May Bring Upheaval ATLANTA, May 17 (U.R) — The Supreme Court decision outlaw- ■ I ing segregation in the nation's I schools will cause the most radii cal upheaval in the South since ( I Reconstruction days. Abolition of the public school, system well may come in a few ! I states, and is a possibility in j others. Several states planned imI mediate special legislative sessions i to decide a course of action. The future of thousands of i Negro teachers was left in doubt. ■ A United Press survey of the , states which are now segregated brought opinions from practically all that Negro teachers Would not , ; be allowed to teach non-segregat- ' ed classes. I Seventeen states have laws re- . ' quiring segregation of white and I | Negro students at the public | : school level. Four others have ; permissive segregation. One state, ' Oklahoma, makes it a misde- ' meanor for a teacher to instruct 1 mixed classes. The South has practiced segre- | gation since the first Negro slaves were \"brought to the country by the Dutch in 1619. Southerners were surprised at the completeness of the high court decision but j were not unprepared. Heavy Showers After Tornadoes Soak Mainland By UNITED PRESS Heavy thundershowers, coming In the wake of scattered tornadoes. soaked the Plains States from the Pecos Valley to Western Nebraska's wheat and cattle country today. ( Meantime, flood waters that rushed into the coastal town of ■ Peabody, Mass., yesterday when 1 a wooden mill pond dam broke began to drop after doing damage which may reach 51,000,000. i At least six tornadoes were reported seen in the Southwest last i night, but none ot them did significant damage or caused any t injuries. Two of the twisters were seen near Lovington, N.M.. and another was spotted near Trlni- ( dad, Colo. Two tornadoes, which . did not touch ground, were reported near Cushing, Okla . and ’ another unconfirmed report said a sixth twister passed near Wa5 tonga, Okla. Thunderstorms, violent In some ' areas, continued today from West 1 Texas northward through WestI em Nebraska. Some ot the heavier important in U.S. race relations since the famous Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that a Negro was not a citizen. The Civil War reversed that decision. Warren said because of the wide ramifications of the decision, formulation of specific decrees will be delayed until further arguments have been heard. But the court by Warren’s opinion today laid down the rule that segregation is \"a denial of equal protection of the laws” to Negroes. This is the phraseology of the 14th amendment to the Constitution, on which the Negroes relied in bringing their cases, Today’s decision was taken in four cases brought originally in four states—South Carolina, Virginia. Delaware and Kansas. Some 9,000,000 white and 2,650 - 000 Negro children attend separate schools in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Arizona, Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming also have segregation in some localities. Invalidates Many Provisions The momentous ruling Invalidates many provisions in State Constitutions, laws and administrative regulations in the 17 states which now require segregation. The 12-page ruling — a document that will rank in sociological significance with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation — swept aside the \"separate but equal doctrine” laid down -by the Supreme Court in 1896. Under that doctrine, the tribunal has held in the past that Negroes must be given educational facilities equal to those afforded white students but that the facilities could be separate. The court’s decision not to issue the specific decrees at this time was apparently in recognition of the complexity of tha <icmre and the physical difficulties involved in putting the ruling into effect. Warren said further arguments will be heard, presumably in the fall, before the decrees are for- . nnilatod . . . .. Can't Turn Baek Clock Warren ■ said that historical data proved \"inconclusive\" as to tlie intent of the framers of the 14th amendment. Warren said, however, that “in approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when the amendment was adopted, or even to 1896 when Plessy V. Ferguson was written. (Plessy vs. Ferguson was the case that established the \"separate but equal doctrine” which Negroes have been fighting for 30 years to ' set aside ) \"We must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the nation. Only in this way can it be determined if segreation in public schools deprives these (complalnants) of the equal protection of the laws.\" \"Today, eddtation is perhaps the most imoortant function of state and local government. . . . \"In these days, it is doubtful ' that any child may reasonably be 1 expected to succeed In life if he ' is denied the opportunity of an '•education. \"Such an opportunity, where , the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be ! made available to all on equal terms.\" Warren then took up the question whether segregation of children in separate buildings, solely j on the basis of race even though physical facilities are equal, deprives colored children of equal edueational opportunities. \"We believe that it does,\" h« said. Recalls Twin Decisions Warren recalled twin decisions of the court in 1950 which required admission of Negro students on an unsegregated basis to state-sup-ported graduate schools in universities in Texas and Oklahoma. He noted that In the Texas case the court found that a segregated law school for Negroes could not provide them with equal educational opportunities because ot certain qualities that can't be measureed but “which make for greatness in a law school.\" In the Oklahoma University case the court held that a Negro admitted to a white school must be treated like all other students because of these same intangible considerations — \"his ability to study, to engage in discussions and exchange views with other students. and. in general, to learn his profession\" BASEBALL 1 I PITTSBURGH.

McClellan (Ark.) c Navy Destroys Ammunition On Wake Isle Civil Aeronautics Administration officials in Honolulu say that a Navy demolition team from Pearl Harbor has exploded or otherwise destroyed “a staggering amount” of live World War II ammunition that had washed ashore at Wake Island In recent weeks. The CAA officials said the N&vy Ordnance ammunition disposal unit WM Caiw To several wefts ago aftei? T high Udes and wind Md. washed th® ammunition ashore. The Navy team spent about 10 days on the tiny island. Among the ammunition destroyed, the CAA said, was one 1,000 pound bomb, one 500-pound bomb, “virtually dozens of 100-poundars,” numerous anti-aircraft ammunition and large amounts of other bombs and shells. They said the ammunition was both American and Japanese, The Japanese took the little Island early in the war and U.S. Forces reconquered it late in the war. Some of the ammunition was carried to an obscure part of the island and exploded. Some of it was taken out in barges and dumped Into the sea. A commerce department an- l nouncemenj. from Washington I said the ammunition was believ- , ed to be mostly from sunken Japanese landing ships that .had rusted through and released their cargoes of shells. ! CAA regional director Edgar N. i Smith and assistant director 1 Ernest Hensley said that World War II ammunition occasionally washes ashore at Wake. But the recent high tides washed such a large accumulation ashore that the CAA manager at Wake Mt it constituted a danger to the is- I land s population, especially the | three to four dozen children of CAA employes living there. | So, the CAA asked the Naw to send a demolition team from I Pearl Harbor to destroy the bombs i and shells.

Crlsol in an announcement late Monday night. MANILA, P.I., May 17 (U.R) — Luis Taruc, the Philippines’ publie enemy No. 1 and leader of the Communist Hukbalahaps, came out of the hills today and surrendered to the government. The balding chieftain of the Red guerrilla group that specialized in wholesale slaughter by am- | bush until they were reduced to i disorganized gangs by President j Ramon Magsaysay, then defense secretary, two years ago, claimed - he gave himself up “to join the i government.” Taruc passed through the front lines with Benigno Aquino, a correspondent for the Manila Times who had interviewed him twice recently. Taruc’s surrender climaxed Magsaysay’s long campaign against the Huks, but the President refused to see him. Negotiations for Taruc’s surrender had been carried on for three months through his son Romeo, who was captured by the Army last year, and Manuel Manahan. AieaMan Facing Knifing Charge Hangs Himself Police say an Airman who was facing trjal for knifing his wife and daughter apparently has taken his own life by hanging. According to detectives, the man —71-year-oljl Kohachiro Kane-shiro—recently told a friend he’d rather be dead than go to jail. He was indicted last Thursday for assault and battery with a weapon. He was charged with stabbing his wife and teen-aged daughter last January during a family quarrel. Kaneshiro’s body was found hanging by a piece of clothes line from a koa tree near the Kuliouou fishponds early yesterday. The body was found by Alfred Nakachi, the son of a friend Kaneshiro had been staying with since the knifing incident. Nakachi’s father, Mori Nakachi, said he had last seen Kaneshiro alive late Saturday night. Mori Nakachi said Kaneshiro told him several days ago: “I’d rather be dead than go to jail.” Motive for N.C.

Farrington said. The delegate’s terse statement continued: “But if it should not be, I desire to give notice now that I will not stand for re-election as Delegate to Congress. I want to be free to pursue the fight for statehood without the limitations and other burdens of this office, and, in the event of statehood, to stand for election to any public office or to move in any direction that, in my opinion, will best serve the public interest. I have been convinced by recent events that the policies in which I believe can be best advanced in this way, and that the time for this announcement is now.” Joseph R. Farrington, president and general manager of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, has served as Hawaii’s delegate in Congress since 1942. Before that he served two four-year terms in the territorial senate. Local Bookkeeper Believed Suicide Honolulu detectives say a 49-year-old retired bookkeeper has apparently committed suicide. He was identified as Nathaniel Wah Chung or 1722 Citron street. He lived alone at that address. The bexiy was found on a bed Sunday afternoon by a nephew. Police say Chung apparently took his own life by plunging an Ice pick into his right temple. Relatives told officers that Chung had been despondent over personal troubles and ill health. He was recently divorced. On a desk near where the body was found was a copy of Norman Vincent Peale’s “Positive Think-ing”—a book which tells how tb meet everyday problems.

Yan Yeh has replaced Gen. Teng Hua as commander of Red ' China’s Army in Korea. The Peiping broadcast said Teng has returned to China. but today it’s small compared to the B-36 or to any Of the half a dozen U.S. Air Force transport planes (MATS) which were, parked in the field not far away. > The transports are three-deckers 1 and are bulky. I Now “Medium Bombers” Because of military aviation progress, the B-29 is now classed , as a “medium bomber.” During ■ World War II medimri bombers ' were two-engined planes such as ' the B-25 Mitchells, some of which ' took part in the first Tokyo raid in 1942 from the carrier Hornet, and the B-26 Martin Marauders, which were used over France before the invasion across the Eng- | lish Channel. These planes were about the size ‘ of today’s TPA Aloha airliners. The B-29’s, operating from Sai- I pan and Tinian Islands, bombed < Tokyo and other Japanese cities in 1944-45, dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and < pUt a quick end to the war. During the Korean war the l Superforts dropped over 185,000 t tons of bombs on enemy targets, i and flew 21,000 missions. Losses i weren’t excessive. Only 15 B-29’s were lost. ’ Those retired are the combat | B-29's.

Partridge, commander of the Far East Air Force with headquarters in Tokyo, and other officials. Impressive Ceremony A brief but impressive ceremony preceded the bomber's departure. Governor King, escorted by military officials, arrived at planeside about seven minutes before 4. Lined up in front of the left wing were ten crew members and some ten feet ahead was Lt. Col. Karl Y. Benson, commander. They were presented lets by 12 Red Cross girls. Governor King shook hands with Col. Benson. Then the governor, Gen. Earle E. Partridge, commander of the Far East Air Force, and Col. Benson shook hands with each of the crew members. At 3:58 Governor King and Col. Benson climbed up a yellow ramp to the nose of the plane, and the Governor placed the orchid lei around a radio antenna at the tip as the 501st Air Force Band played “Aloha Oe.“ With the Governor at the planeside ceremony were Gen. Partridge, the Far East Air Force commander; Maj. Gen. Sory Smith, commander of the Pacific Air Force; Brig. Gen. Harold B. Maddux, deputy commander of the Pacific division of MATS, and Mrs. Walter F. DIJlingham, whose son, Capt. Gaylord Dillingham, was killed in July, 1945, when his B-29 was shot down over Japan. Governor Bids Aloha Asked for comment after the ceremony. Governor King said: “Despite splendid services in the Pacific war and in the Korean conflict, the B-29 is outmoded by, new developments in military aviation and is being retired. I bid aloha to this plane.\"’ On the left side of the plane’s nose, below the pilot's cabin, were inscribed the words, “Work wen done! Aloha.” The propellers started moving about 4:01 as the band played “The Wild Blue Yonder,\" the official Air Force song, and the plane headed makal two minutes later.

Crowley. His attorney. David E. Bradshaw, demanded that Bedwell, who is charged with the murders of the Grimes sisters, Barbara, 15, and Patricia, 13. be admitted to bail on the ground that his purported confession is obviously false. Bedwell was on the witness stand when the hearing recessed until this afternoon. In the statement which Sheriff Joseph Lohman said Bedwell Signed, the Skid Row drifter related that he and a companion named \"Frank” had taken the Grimes sisters on a week-long sex and drinking spree.

Bedwell testified one of the sheriff's officials he said beat him was \"the chief of sheriff’s police.” Lohman denied Bedwell was beaten and said Bedwell lied on the witness stand. He said he still considers Bedwell the prime suspect in the case \"even more so now than when we first took his confession.” He did not elaborate. Earlier, the sheriff said “I still believe, and so does everyone else, that he is the man. 2 Japanese Women Will Tour U.S. to ' Fight Nuclear Tests TOKYO, Jan. 31 (AP) — Two Japanese women leave here Feb. 5 for the United Nations and a three-week tour of the United States, pleading for abolition of further thermonuclear tests.

PRICE EIGHT CENTS HUGE DOPE SMUGGLING RING IS SMASHED Guard Troops Prevent Integration Governor Insists He Is Not Challenging Federal Court Order LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Sept, 4 (API—National Guardsmen called out by Gov. Orval Faubus today forcibly prevented racial integration of Central High School and Faubus insisted at a news conference later that he is not defying a Federal Court order. The grim-faced soldiers, armed with rifles and carbines, turned back nine Negro students who tried to enroll at the 2,000-pupil all-white school. The troops controlled a disorderly crowd which Jeered the Negroes, who were led by a welldressed unidentified white man. Faubus maintained that his only purpose in calling out 250 white guardsmen Monday night was to \"maintain peace and order.” Referring to a decision by Federal Judge Ronald Davies last night ordering the Little Rock school board to \"proceed forthwith with Integration\" despite the presence of troops around the school, Faubus said today: \"The governor of the state is the preservator of peace, not a Federal Judge.” Asked why local and state police could not deal with violence,, if it occurred, Faubus said that \"it is better to preserve peace than to quell disorders.\" An aide said Faubus had received about 500 telegrams since his mobilization of troops. More than 98 per cent favored the move, the governor's aide said. Ne»ro Stopped Faubua said at his news conference that Negroes were stopped this morning under his orders. The off-again, on-agaln integration of Central was an uncertain issue as classes began today. The state branch of the National Association for, the Advancement of Colored People, after learning that’ the school board had given the green light to Negro students again last night, announced some would try to enroll. A crowd of some 300 whites milled about in front of the school shouting such phrases as •‘Nigger go back where you belong” but the whites made no attempt to harm the Negroes. Maj. Gen. Sherman T. Clinger. Arkansas adjutant general, said the guardsmen, all whites, were acting on the governor’s orders. “Gov. Faubus has declared Central High off limits to Negroes,” Clinger told newsmen. Negro Girl Turned Back An unaccompanied 15-year-old Negro girl made the first attempt to cross through a line of about 200 soldiers standing shoulder-to-shoulder. As she repeatedly attempted to pass through the formation, an armed guardsman stepped forward and silently turned her back. She was followed a few minutes later by a Negro boy, also 15. who walked up to the guardsmen but made no attempt to pass. The Negroes were led by a welldressed white man, who could not Immediately be identified. The crowd of whites, which doubled in size almost at the instant the Negro girl appeared, was noisy and abusive in its language compared to the quiet, orderly crowd of 500 which gathered in front of the high school yesterday. Faubus has maintained that the National Guard was not called out Monday night to maintain segregation at the school but only to keep “peace and order.” Blocking of Integration However, the Little Rock school board interpreted the move as a block to Integration and temporarily called off its Federal Courtapproved gradual desegregation plan which had been scheduled to become effective with school opening yesterday. Last night, Federal Judge Ronald Davies for the second time since Friday directed the board to proceed with integration at Central High. The Negro girl, who identified herself as Elizabeth Echford, was engulfed by whites as she attempted to pass through the guardsmen. They shouted “Niger go back where you belong” and LAFF-A-DAY \"Why don’t you just enjoy the ride, now that you don’t have to worry about my driving?” l JemBKoL WKi ' Wfl 1 HHr i. wWj : HBr- 'JflH!

Counsel Says She “Designed” To Discredit Judge WASHINGTON, May 20 (AP)— The Supreme Court today heard an assertion that Mrs. Harriet Bouslog Sa-rfyer, suspended Honolulu attorney, had followed a \"program or design” to discredit the judge and court during the 1952 trial of seven Smith Act defendants. The assertion was made by A. William Barlow, counsel for Bar Association of Hawaii, in the second day of arguments on an ap ? peal by Mrs. Sawyer. Barlow declared that the woman’s speech “showed a pattern, not a spontaneous explanation or suggestion.” \"It was part of a program or design to bring discredit on the Judge and the court,” ho declared. “It was to show that the Smith Act trials were In effect a conspiracy. She was preaching that the government and .the trial court were conspiring.” Yesterday the Supreme Court was told that Harriet Bouslog Sawyer was deprived of her right of free speech by a one-year suspension from practice for unprofessional conduct. Mrs. Sawyer was attorney for Jack Hall, Hawaii regional director of vt h e International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, during the 1952-53 trial of Hall and six others In Federal Court In Honolulu on charges of Hoisting the Smith Act. ' She was suspended by the Ter-E-lal Supreme Court April , on a complaint filed by the rail Bar Association following In Investigation requested- by the Federal- district Judge who conducted .the trial. i f '* She wha aceueed of havlng finpugned the integrity of the Judge In a speech she made at Honokaa on the Island of Hawaii while the trial was in progress. John T. McTernan, Los Angeles attorney tor Mrs. Sawyer, told the Supreme Court the findings, of Territorial court were arbitrary because they were based on a news story and incomplete notes of a newspaper reporter. Irrelevant, Says McTernan ’McTernan contended the news story was not relevant since It used only four or five sentences out of context from a 30 minute speech. Justice Felix Frankfurter commented a lawyer should expect that kind of treatment. “That happens every day in the best of newspapers,’’ Frankfurter said. “It Is to be expected that if she makes an hour’s speech the newspapers won’t use an hour’s worth. They'll pick out the hot stuff.” McTernan argued, however, that a lawyer’s license should not hinge on such a situation. He contended a lawyer has responsibility to inform the public about Improper operations of the rules of law. “Not a lawyer in a case while the case is on,” Frankfurter said. “The court room is the place for her urging — not the market place.” Appeal From S.F. Court The case reached the Supreme Court on appeal of Mrs. Sawyer from a 1958 ruling of U.S. Supreme Court in San Francisco affirming the attorney’s suspension. A. William Barlow, U.S. attorney In charge of the 1952 Smith Act trial, represented the Hawaii Bar Assocation in today’s argument. He said the case was not decided upon meager evidence but that Mrs. Sawyer had made other speeches referring to the Judges engaging In witch hunts In connection with Smith Act trials. Barlow told the court that after Mrs. Sawyer's Honokaa speech, she was no longer on the speechmaking brigade of the ILWU. HerfetXsks Reds To Reconsider Peace Rejection GFNEVAf May 20 (AP) — U. 8.

Hicks spoke at a news conference opening the convention of the Pacific Coast Electrical Associaton. He Is the associaton’s president. Investors seem to be Intrigued with the idea of buying land on Oahu and elsewhere, Hicks reported. The demand appears to be mainly for sites for hotels and apartments. One group of newcomers bought parcels of land on the Big Island of Hawaii. They got tracts several acres in size, each for $500 or $600 and bought them sight unseen, Hicks said. On arrival they found no roads and no water. They are living in tents and hauling water eight miles, he added. An unusually large proportion of the newcomers this year have been from the Pacific Northwest, particularly Oregon and Washington. Other elements Include businessmen looking forward to seipi-retirement who appear to be planning to open business offices in the Islands and at the same time retain their mainland connections. Two cement plants, an oil refinery, a steel mill which will use much of Hawaii’s scrap, and a wire drawing plant are being built and will help provide work for the expected addition to the island labor force, Hicks said. An important role of Hawaii will be to constitute a sociological bridge between the United States and Asia, Hicks said.

A. H. King, a Tallahassee plantation owner, described how the verdict was reached as an atmosphere of calm returned to this Florida capital city after weeks of '.-teisjjon.-^'' King said that \"on the basis of the testimony before us there was evidence of threats with a gun and knife but no brutality was involved.” The foreman said the case was decided on “the law and the evidence\" without any consideration of race. “We would have returned the same verdicts if the defendants had been four Negroes,” King said. k Four Negroes are awaiting execution in the state prison for raping white women. Double Standard, Says Pastor One Negro pastor said refusal of the all-white male jury to send the four to the electric chair would give Negroes charged with rape a double standard, talking point at their trials. Dr. Ar-Joseph Reddick, pastor of the Bethel Arne Church and a former state president of the NAACP,* said it was his opinion the decision against-jp d e a t h penalty resulted from “ingrained prejudice by a white jury.\" Alteteugh Reddick's comment* 1 The four defendants appeared Stunned by, the VtBflnt, TiiW iRtra whisked off to Halford State Prison after the.-.Jury reported at 12:35 a.m. yesterday; There was not a murmur in the ’ packed segregated courtroom as the verdict was announced.

All was quiet on the aU-Negro Florida A&M University campus where the victim was a freshman. Passive demonstrations were staged by students there last month when the case developed.

No nutter how serious or debased a crime may be that is committed in Hawaii, the law cannot demand a human life in forfeit. Hawaii has no death penalty. For this reason we of Hawaii cannot fairly criticize the decision of a Florida jury to spare the lives of four white youths convicted of raping a Negro girl. But we can find fault with the reason for the jury’s decision as given by the jury foreman. - - The foreman says the jury decided against the death penalty because there was no evidence of brutality in the rape. This is like saying a murderer should escape the severest possible penalty because he killed without causing his victim undue pain. j What can be more brutal than the rape of a girl by four Just-crazed young men? Just how much more evidence of brutality than gang rape at gun and pistol point does a Florida jury demand? These questions we would like for the members of the Florida jury to answer — if they can. We are not crying for the life blood of the four convicted youths. We are decrying the reasoning of the jury. If there is no brutality in any form of mass rape\" — then there is no such thing as butality. To reason otherwise is not to reason at all. YES, YES,-YES FOR STATEHOOD! Mrs. Eleanor S.

(Continued fmm list Sunday) Christianization of Japan is n slow process. In an insular nation. 1 where nothing comes and goes with revolution but evolution, ji brilliant history of evangelism is impossible. Vet Christianity in Japan has grown a I read v a tremendous power ' within the past half century. The V. M. C. A. movement and Sunday 'chool organization are at present '•inch in vogue, and Christianity is drawing its adherents from diverse source*, particularly through these agencies. No sectarian feeling has 1 ever been strong, but it is gradually warring with the rise of iinionistic sentiment, emphasizing the essen--1 tialsof the faith and neglecting the \"linoi traditional points, The in- ’ flneiiee being keenly felt even across the Macille Ocean. Japanese churches in this country are now agitating for the union’of all Mrot- • estaiit denominations. 11 is often asked if Christianity ! in Japan is indigenous enough to dispense with the material aid ' forthcoming from various mission boards. Whether yes or no. tin* fact is obvious that native Christ • ians are rapidly awakening to the - sense of their own responsibility. I and the plan of independence is taking a definite shape. The Congregational Church has long been independent and others are soon to follow the example, though yet hampered by financial conditions. Such move toward independence • and ei -operative union amply tes. ‘ tify the slreriL'th of Christianity already rooted deep in Japan. > Another .significant fact is the • I wide-spreading of Christian litera- ■ 11lire and journals.

Wherever the govi rnment has under control large numbers of men and women, as. for example, in the army, the navy, the police fore.-, the public hospitals, asylums, ami convalescent stations, they force changes of diet on the persons under authority. For instance, they mix barley with the > ice. or they put more meat or fish uto lie* rations issued.

These practices prove great intelligence not only in the government, but also in fin- common people as ;■ whole; and the results of their practices in preventive medicine m their hospitals and dispemmrie*. and in their treatment of private cases have more thon equalled that of any Occidental nation.

They prove beyond question that Tin- Japanese possess as a race fine physical, mental, and moral eu dowments. Their dominant sentiment is an intense patriotism, in which pride. loyally, and love anardently united. Are they, then,| lion to the competing national forces of the world/ Is their demonstrated strength dangerou* to the peace of the world and to the while race? The Japanese are not ;« warlike people, in spite of the fact that they have wager! within a few years! two wars in which they took tli 1 part of invaders.

In fl.oc wars the .. million soldier’s I motive was an intense patriotism not love of glory or a natural low for fighting. < r a desire for new conquests and possesions. The Japanese are not a numerous people. They number not more than oiie-iiinth part of the (’bines, population, or more than one-third of the population of Russia, and less than one-half of the population of the I nitial States. They are a homing people. Tlie\\ are commercially adventurous, and will travel far and wide as ped dh-rs. or in search of I rude or work: Inn they are not colonists. The Japanese government has had great difficulties in inducing Japanese in -etth- in Formosa; and at the pre.s--nl moment il has a similar diffi•nlty in Korea, although the K■ .••an climate resembles that of Japan A hot climate the Japan -•se dislike.

This fact is one of the results of universal education in Japan; for under the Japine.se feudal system the trader held the lowest place in tin- social structure. 1 in the Japanese view he.was not a producer, flood business ethics and particularly the sanctity of contracts have now lieen taught in all Japanese schools for more than a generation; and the Imperial Oovcrmncnt has recognized the importance of commerce end trade in modern civilization by conferring titles and other distinctions on successful and serviceable business men. The American agents in Japan of large American corporations, such as the Standard Oil Company and the Singer Sewing Machine Company, declare without reservation that the Japanese are just as satisfactory people to deal with a.s the Americans. Casual tourists, who sec nothing of jthe Japanese except in the hotels i md in the few shops for foreigners j which they visit, sometimes get the Miipn-wion that much chaffering inecessary in order l-> obtain Japans«- wares at proper prices; but this is not a characteristic habit of Japanese dealers among themselves, j md * -Veil the foreigner will (hid it Japanese city or town shops w**rthe prices are .just as fixed as they are in American department stores, rind an* equally plainly mnrki’il on the goods offered for sale.

The existed and still does exist a group of men and women in America who liked or like Japan because Japan was or is so fundamentally different from all other countries of the world. To these people charm and strangeness are inseparable qualities in Japan. The Mount Fuji is charming but only because sbe is strangely unique among the mountains of tin* world. Nikko is charming but because there nature and art are brought into harmony strangely unrealized in the West. Japanese gardens are charming—nature in its completeness is actually brought before your eyes regardless of spaces allotted to them, an art altogether unknown in the West. Japanese art products are charming and value is focused upon their strangeness. Dut more strange is the author of these strange mid therefore charming arts. He is so unwestern. therefore so unhuman, that is to say beyond -the comprehension of Western minds. Nevertheless, he is charming because In* is strange; indeed, every act of his is strange, and his surrounding is fantastic. The blacksmith squats at his anvil. The carpenter pulls his plane and saw. The Japanese speak backwards, read backwards and write backwards. Surely they are a strange folk.

Il is already a long time since the white peoples have obtained the dominaney over the world and the power to behave as they I please; they have plumed themselves as if they were a selected I people since the time of Greece and the Roman Empire. Indeed, from the end of tin* Roman Empire until the .beginning of the modern age, Europe was often invaded by the Orientals. Mongolians, Turks and Tartars, being the objects of the fear j <*f Occidentals, but these three i hundred years, being the golden age of the white peoples, no other peoples hits been able to stand before them. It is no wonder that they have organized a “white clan.” What the white are most proud of before the other peoples is their religion; they consider them I selves to be (he select people of God, and call others with the de [nomination of “the heathen.” What if this heathen people wen •onverted to Christianity.’ Havt they given equal treatment to them? The oUservation of facts leads us to conclude without tin least hesitation that they have not treated them equally. In fact, they used to look upon them as if they were captives on the battlefield, and seemed to con sider them easy to deal with. In* cause of their conversion. Hutting the instances in Japan aside, observe what treatment the mi I live Christians in China and Korea arc receiving from missionaries, and you will easily Ih (able to understand what I mean ! Suppose for a while that then had not been the Chino-Japancs* | war, the Boxer trouble and tie Russo-Japanese war. and that th* Japanese were all converted t« ; Christianity. Could the Japanese have sue ceeded in revising tin* treaties with the Bowers.' Could Japan have attained such a high position las she is now in? We cun not reply in the alTirm ative. She obtained her position by the gospel of might. Hut for their might the Japanese are but an obsolete colored people. When we speak of the colored there is il\" distinction between yellow and black. Therefore to exclude tin- colored people# as heathens is only a pretext, because if they convert them to Christianity they will no doubt he excluded on another ground. Of course, there are few people in Europe and America who act in accordance with the (Jospel of Love, which they preach Hut the general tendency is quite contrary, and it is next to impossible to crush “the white elan” hy making ourselves ('heist ia us. Indeed, the other races are to hhune for (his organization of’ the “white elan,” because it is largely due to their powerlessness. In other words, the insults they an now receiving from the white race is nothing but the result of their own imitation. We should not entertain any enmity against tin white race, hut should endeavor to crush the “white elan” in tin cause of humanity as well as in the interests of ourselves, and s* stand on an equal footing with them. There may he many wayfor attaining this purpose, hut we diould always insist upon Justin md righteousness when we an treated otherwise. The reason why they have formed the “white elan” being first of all. their superiority in power, the first condition foi .•rushing it is to become powerfu 1 md then to make good use of that power in the cause of justice and righteousness, to convince then that there an* equal races besidehcmselves.

AMERICA’S PAST AND PRESENT. America *»f today is not America of yesterday. Many a metamorphosis has this country undergone wince its founding. It was founded upon the principle of “All men arc created equal.” The eir(ninstance* demanded it. The idea was borrowed from the Swiss, and was later handed to the French radicals. These Frenchmen soon discovered that the principle was altogether too divine. Tliey changed its meaning to mean “equality before man-made-law”. The meaning was accented in America, lint slavery existed here and a further modification was necessary. Itoth before and after the emancipation proclamation the principle even in its modified meaning was to be applied to only white persons. In behalf of these white persons, many humane acts were done by j America, guided by her principle of justice and equality. In 18tW| Congress adopted an act the preamble of which reads: “Whereas tie* light of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people.! indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, etc.” Hut the expression, “all people”, was made * vidently for effect, for in 18H2 another act was passed by the same! body, which says: “that hereafter no State court or court of the I idled States shall admit Chinese to citizenship; and all laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed”. Chinese have positively been; refused to share in all the blessings guaranteed by the net of 1808. Moreover, the existing naturalization law “shall apply to aliens being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent”. In other words, the black and while alone are chosen to enjoy the right “indispensable to the enjoyment of the right of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness” in America. Anything between lhese two extreme colors is fixed unworthy of that fundamental right of life. In reality then, neither the principle of “all men are created equal”, nor tin* principle of “equality before the law” now exists in America. They arc no longer the guiding principles of the American nation. America does no longer claim for having such principles. She is nut entitled to it. In the days gone by when liuiiiaii hands were needed “all people” : of the world were* induced, or at least, encouraged to'come to America. Hut today sin* is abundant in her human hands, if not overabundant. America’s wisdom now demands that her gale must he closed against the inflowing tide of humanity. Alas! even Europeans now come under the ban. And the justification of this inhuman stand is that European nations have abused America by making it their “dumping ground” of their “scums”. Vet these very “scums” have been partially responsible for the unparalleled progress of American civilization in the same way as the Chinese and .Japanese have been partially responsible for lie- rapid development of California. Hut let America speak her p regent will. I quote from Professor Fetter of Princeton I’niversify: “The American sentiment in favor of the open door to the oppressed of all lands ss*a part of our national heritage. The wish to share with others the blessings of freedom and of economic plenty is the product of many generations of American < xpcrience. The open door policy had partly a political basis; a growing population in a young and sparsely settled country gave greater security on the frontier of settlement and greater strength against foreign enemies. The policy bad. however, mainly an economic basis: land was here a free good on the margin of a vast frontier. Most citizens lieiielited by a growing population Let it not be accounted cynicism to recognize in Ibis national self-interest the source of a generous sentiment toward the incoming stranger.

It is stated that the naval authorities have decided to construct ’ three battleships, each of 30.500 tons, at tie* Yokosuka Naval D«»ekyard, tKola* Kawasaki Dockyard and the Mitsubishi Dockyard at Nagasaki. Provisionary contracts have already lieen entered into with the two private dockyards. Thes ■ battleships will be sister ships of battleship A. which i** now building at the Kure Naval Dockyard, and when completed will be tlie most powerful super Dread noughts of the Japanese navy It is estimated that their const met ion will take three years.

Professor Fetter concludes his paper in these won I “Already we have on our map ninny cities swarming like ant hills, the delight of the real estate .speculator and the despair of true friends of humanity. Shall it Ik* our ideal to multiply men on city streets and in smoking snburlis. away from Helds and forests and, mountains: or shall we not rather give to all our people space to earn an ample living and to live an ample life, worthy of our democratic ideal?” National self-interest is what America now primarily see|-> even at the expense of humanity at large. Hut America is not to Im* condemned! on this score, for “nation above humanity” is tin* motto of nib modern nations. YAMATO in 11 HASH I. A PROPOSAL TO SOLVE THE JAPANESE PROBLEM. Since the alien land bill was brought forth to 1..- d' •ns> d at j the capital during the hist session the general sentiments. I,nth for and against the Japanese, have been stirred up »••••• ntl in California.] To our great regret the passing of the bill happen i to cause an international question between the I’nited States and Japan. We.i however, have many reasons to think that the diplomat><• negotiations) will settle the matter smoothly and satisfactorily between the two countries sooner or later. We have not an ear t<. lend to good for-j nothing war clamors of jingoists at present. From the very beginning of the problem in California tin* public opinions among Americans, especially among Californians, were divided into two distinct tendencies; one being for and the other against the Japanese, and because the so-called anti-Japanese! opinions are commonly taken for the popular vomw of California! toward the Japanese, we are going to confine our consideration to the latter only. It will he strange to say that the opinions of those who disfavor the Japanese in California are not only discordant lint also very often quite contradictory to each other. If yon listen to tie* vuiei*s raised against the Japanese you will find to your great surprise that the two quite opposite opinions are prevailing, i. e . some despising the Japanese ns an inferior race, while others looking at them with rather a sort of fear as a promising people. Under such circumstances, it will be hard to ascribe the reason of California disfavor against the Japanese to one or the other exclusively. Hut the most popular voice raised against the Japanese is little or no ußsimilability of the Japanese. Let ns see, then, how far and in what sense this is ae--1 cep I a hie. Assimilation as such is the change of things from one state to another under some one’s influence. So assimilation presupposes j some factors strong enough to cause such change. Mayo-Smith, an eminent sociologist in America, enumerates three influences tending to assimilate the foreign and the native elements in this country in his treatise on “Assimilation of Races in tin- Fnited States.” which as as follows: I Intermarriage; J common .school education. mid I political life. It is true that there are some more factors enforcing assimilation, but ns the above mentioned three* are; tin* most drastic oNidl. we shall see how these influences are acting I upon tin* Japanese in California. In the first place, “assimilation by intermarriage, 1 * says MayoSmith. ”is the natural \\tny of welding diverse nationalities and races into one nation. Thereby is brought about an actual intermixture of blood, and a community of customs and habits of life, which efface any previous differences.” Now, how is it with the •Japanese in California? The existing marriage law of California prohibits intermarriage of the Japanese and the white people. Thus the only natural way id* assimilation, according to Mayo-Smith, is nnfortunately closed to the Japanese in California. く |1^ ，1 1#，， 、 鼴 1 知 I 4： ねこ 、 2 ' 一 .V 400 14 ぃぐゎン ‘2‘ ン必 5 札化 ？ ざょだ 」 》 がせられ虹て氏の >3 ろ記 “. 理 』 “ | 微 ^ ：^ 屮巧の 5 3 っ ；： 4 「 3 ガ ：： い ：！ へら . 00 V の X *3I5!0 *0 趴 ©06I(0&? び *>. , 0I;^6^^; № ,^ 趴たる舴 1^^0 ざな - 全 ^ に -：^ 傾りて I I か - ぽ如ふ起おびが起のぽ仇か £.2 失せて必 4 治するビぃふ佐期でぁル - 0 此六 ！ 0 六號 1 注射す — ;2*1 ハ ； 被 . こは 1¢ 入の的中にて备 」 病め療沾 」 にて 16 に 1 治 ^^ ， ぼさる赢 111|！， 通 ^； 0| は |% ， 阶であ 4 ¢¢ ¢¢^ ー 度 I: 小 (I!£ な -^ て讲泄され病氣全快 ¢ いふこ ¢ こ .？^% る 0 # 驚啖すべき治療法六百六 ^ 8： #： の敗ぬ昨年 №^ 界 1: 名 *^->- V; 0^ せし (9 於ける ¢0 ¢9 學 2 士 I: 六 ^ ょ 6 て好 5 せられし 「 防 3 娘 <¢810 ダ梅法 」 は 6^！2 身の痰ばなら 120 刃ぎ蟛蜞の丨巧肪汁 ，^ 取 0^^ ； ごぁ 4 んに十だ ， ろか師を 3！： ぶ ^； は备でぁ 6 。 1 ， 從ふ ：： ぷ ^ ? 々忽 ：^ して滅亡せしひ去し 4, ぼした ， 〇 笵 ： あのン ^ ほ ；！！^ ：^ て ；1 ら ：； 。 2 纟 1 、 5： ー 1 纪のボ ^1 5：|^“ は骺に ， ？ ： ？ ぞ翁入院 53 の 3 ': 十當は ^ 尝 … 入院 1: 一を ^ みし - のは . 其のポギ化泰 ^: は出をな ，^ : 。 0 一つ多年の酃驗を有せる 3 白滔 0 好 |： ょりて十 1; い ー ” しぼ :^ 品 ： の ^ 紜かくぽ次 5|： 5 五 1！；， 甚装は 585 らざる 3 注 140， 麵 <1 朽ザヘ鼇為は ， V 鼈 I1 ねべ丨 ' ”11 んご \" つ费 ， 时ニ ^ て害 !)5 < 銪 IE I1#!^ I* ((!1№ 士 I# V¢!; 十 ¢ I111 の聍明ご ” 驗 ¢.V¢ ね參 ,，:.\"!?:?.

But the educational result of Japanese children in public schools in this country is showing us how easily the Japanese as a race is assimilable if properly conducted. Finally, as to the influence of political life. Mayo-Smith says I “There is no doubt that the • xercise of political rights ha> had a , powerful effect in assimilatin'' the men of different nationalities and making them fed 1 ik«- one nation; the policy of the l'nit«*d Stubs in conferring upon persons, coming to this country with the Intention of remaining, the same political rights which the native horn enjoy, has been founded not only upon tin* doctrine of tie • quality of men. hut also upon the desire to bring all men into a uni tied liody politic.” Indeed, it has been a wise policy i nfer equal political rights upon the naturalized citizens with the native Isirn. but to onr great regret, the Japanese in America arc treated as imdigibles. and a.- such an not entitled to any political right**. Tims the Japanese in America have been kept aside from the m**J powerful influences of assimilation through the political 1 if**. From what wc have wen. we eati safc|\\ sa\\ that tin* Japanev have been placed under the most nnfav »rahle. or rather adverse 1 should say. circumstances to he assimilated in America, as tin* consequences of the policies carried on by America as w.

It is therefore unreasonable to sa> that the Japanese in California jiln assimilate little lieeanse they “would not” or 'cannot.” but b* ,I cause America as well as California do refuse to assimilate with them. !

EDITOR T\" SATURDAY, EMPEROR’S BIRTHDAY SINCE PEACE Yesterday was the day set for the celebration of the auspicious jeeasion of His Majesty’s birthday. It was the day on which the list natal anniversary of the Emperor of Japan, whose civil and nilrtant virtues arc rcnouncil, was observed by the Japanese people. As we. people of the Japanese empire celebrate the Birthday each :car , we find, a new significance attached to the occasion. Our naional prestige progresses with rapid strides. Step by step Japan is {sing among the powers of the world. Jn her civilization and in her rt3 lili, Japan of today is not the Japan of a year ago. As we calmly reflect upon the year that gone by, and at the ante time meditate the year that comes with its auspicious occasion, miold joy and gratitude gush from the bottom of our heart. Yesterday’s event held in honor of the Birthday of the Emperor ru made more significant by the fact that it was the first Birthday linrc the conclusion of (he World War which for four and a half rears wrought destruction upon the world. , > Tlle participation in the World War elevated JapanTolhc ranlTof the Five (ireat Powers. A country, which was hitherto recognized merely a power the Orient, has become a world power, and is looked up as such. To Japan, this means an unparalleled forward move which should be long remembered. Not only the Japanese but other colored races may be well proud of the forward move of the Island Empire. In behalf of the yellow races of the Orient and of the black race that have groaned under the heels of the while, Japan, it may he said, .sounded the trumpet, which in every respect is significant. • * Thus the Japanese nation is, in a certain sense, the champion of the colored races of the . world. While her honor is great with regard to this respect, the confidence which the people of the world repose in her is still greater. Consequently, at limes, Japan, becomes the traget of attack and criticism, and witnesses unjustified hut unavoidable anti-Japanese actions in many quarters. Hut the Japanese people should remain disinterestedly and impartially, correct what ought to be corrected, introspect what ought to be introspected, march onward with the world trend, develop their national resources, long keep the nation in the position which she holds, and show the world the true object which she is striving for. To attain this object, the Japanese at abroad should he united in thought, abolish all customs and practices, which arc wrong, and breath the atmosphere of the new era. This is their duty and the way to repay that great favor of the royal family, whose uninterrupted line of emperors find no parallel in the world. We, Japanese residing in a foreign land, seeing the national prosperity of the mother country, far in the distant, arc overtaken with a sense of gratitude all the more. May long live His Majesty in glory, and his 60,000,000 subjects in peace and harmony. H. C. L. AFFECTS SCHOOL BOYS (Special Cable to the Nippu Jiji) TOK'l 0, Nov.

SAYS LABORERS HANDLED LIKE BEASTS BY ‘LUNA’ Plantation Laborers On This Island Tell Of Indignities They Suffer \" ’Plantation laborers goaded on like leasts by old-fashioned Innas', the audiority for which is no \"less a personage than a prominent Haolc residing in Honolulu, sounds today like a phrase which merely remains in our memory as suggesting the unpleasant labor conditions of the past,” said a laborer who works on a plantation on this island to a representative of this ( paper, “but the melancholy truth is that it is about as true as it was two decades ago. \"Male laborers are actually 'goaded on like beasts by old-fashioned lunas* on this plantation, today. Some of our lunas direct the laborers as if they were handling animals. Kvidcntly forgetting that they arc handling men instead of beasts of burden, they say to the laborers *Go lied, go bed.' They wouldn’t even let the laborers look at their watches and still less let them smoke. And to cap the climax they lake up all watches and tobacco if they happen to know the laborers have any. \"Ibis is an outrageous condition that can’t and shouldn't he tolerated even for a second in free America where all men arc supposed to he created equal. We lal>orcrs arc no less a man than the lunas who want us believe we arc beneath the common level of man. To urge* us on- | ward as if we were beasts is distinctly Prussianistic, a stench in the nostrils not only of America but of common decency. To deprive us of the’ right of keeping harmless things in our pockets is not only an encroachment on our dignity, which every man has, but is also an infringement of our inalienable rights. “This is outrageous even when applied to men, and so wh&V it is applied none the less to woman labor, as it actually is, it becomes intolerable, and I believe it becomes high time that the civic organizations of HonolulU' advocating decent Hawaii called a hall. Why don’t woman laborers with normal amount of self-respect and personal dignity refrain from working hi the fields if they want to them, you ask? The reason is very simple. They simply have to work in order to fill the deficiency in their husbands’ wages and avoid starvation. Otherwise takes a mighty incorrigible fool to work like beasts for $l5 a month at the sacrifice of their dignity, their health, the well being of their children, many of whom arc under five years of age. \"It was about 50 years ago that Abraham Lincoln emancipated the slaves. And today, in the year of our Lord 1919, in this beautiful Hawaii, the Paradise of the Pacific, an integral part of the greatest democracy of the planet, the nation that has proved itself a potent factor in sav-. ing the world, and fathered the movement for the federation of the world, there prevails a condition among laborers that is little short of that which obtained among the negroes pro-1 vious to the emancipation proclamation, “I’d lie very glad if you would air ail these disgraceful conditions to the intelligent citizens of Honolulu, so ' PROMINENT MEN OF CITY PLAN RECEPTION FOR BARON S.

Lieutenant Ito was posthumously promoted to lieutenant commander. The calamity causing the injury and subsequent death of Lieutenant Commander and the sailors occurred when a fire broke out in one of the turrets of the Battleship Hiuga on which they were. Another officer who died as a result of accident sustained during the manoeuvre and given posthumous promotion is Lieutenant Commander Sasao, advanced to the rank of commanor. Lieutenant Comandcr Sasao was washed off the bridge of the Destroyer Harnakaze during the practice battle, the sea being unusually rough that day. that Hawaii might be redeemed from this profoundly medieval condition.\" [ENGLISH.SECTION NQVEMBER 1, 1919.

If I am disposed of as a leader, there arc many more able Filipinos who can lake my place and lead the higher wage movement. No. the manager of the Waimanalo Plantation cannot scare us nor the entire Filipino labor through what he did to us four Filipinos Wednesday evening. Consequently any attempt to squelch the higher wage movement among the Filipino laborers can never succeed.” Manlapit. however, thinks that the “unlawful and false imprisonment\" of he and in* comrades has done some damage to them. William J. Sheldon, attorney for Manlapit, sent a demand to the Waimanalo Sugar Company yesterday, claiming a damage of $lO,- ( HKi. in the following effect: “Cnder instruction of my client Pablo Manlapit, 1 hereby make mand on you for the sum of $lO,OOO in settlement of damages sustained by him by reason of his unlawful and false imprisonment and restraint in the Honolulu police station on October 20th and 30th, 1919. the said unlawful and false imprisonment and restraint caused by your employe and servant f I Gorge Chalmers Jr.\""

I iITORIAL | | Progress In Race p Problem | Discriminate feelings between different races constitute a deeprooted question. Things that ■ can lie readily analyzed at a glance cannot he properly solved some times, which renders the question all the more complicated and interesting. K There is little feeling between jjace* in Hawaii. That is why i the Territory of Hawaii is being . looked upon with pride as the; melting pot of races. Another recent contribution by Hawaii to the settlement of the hvoidd’s racial question has been unearthed. That is the recognition of the establishment of the Lions’ Club in Hawaii, whose membership is open to all races, and the elimination from its charter of the , clause limiting membership to I white people. Like the Rotary and other imilar clubs, the Lions strive or community and social ends. Tiere are more than 2,000 ranches throughout the United dates, which give influence to his organization. The establish-ment-of a branch in Hawaii and he elimination of the \"white «ople” clause from its mem«rship constitutes a daring acion. To Director Ford and lecretary Kurokawa of the ’an-Pacific Union should go the redit of working directly and ndirectly for this end. The elimination of the words white people, etc.” from the $ charter of the local Lions’ club 9? may merit attention. It cannot , ; ' ! vtie said that although the club ffi welcomes Oriental members just t! as sincerely as white members, t,it accords the same treatment IB the black race. Thd black ice. alone is left out. We regret hat the amendment was not tade so that all races would ave been included in the Lions’ lub! High buildings Have a low BundatJon. The inclusion of irientals in its membership, Owever, is a step toward eraicating the racial prejudice motig the white race. This is contribution toward solving me racial problem. Racial problems cannot be ettled overnight. It is a perpe- , tual question difficult of solu--3 tiqn. We must not slacken in 4 our-efforts. We must always ;1 take advantage of opportuniil ties and work for the satisfactory solution of the question. For this reason, we look upon : * with interest to the recent action || on the part of the Lions’ club. i ; The Dead Is Loser K The trial of a murder case occurring in 1917 was postponed 1 for'various reasons until 1921 when it was formally opened. . ,Thc defendant in the case was ‘ ;conyjcted of second degree murt dcr; and sentenced to not less | ithart 20 years nor more than 30 j Vears.

The Dover Express arid East Kent News print the following : “So far little information has been given of the details of Miss Edcrle's swim—the most extraordinary thing about it being that she made no westward drift with the ebb tide, which, on the day in question, ran westward for nearly seven hourrat an average speed of nearly two knots.” The Westminister Gazette prints an interview obtained by its Folkestone correspondent with a Folkestone skipper, who is quoted as saying that if Miss Ederlc had not had the protection of the tug she would have been carried far down the Goodwins off Ramsgate- Commenting on the matter, the Westminister Gazette says: “A keen controversey has arisen among the seafaring people on each - side of the channel as to the assistance which Miss Ederlc received duHng the recent strenuous and successful feat. Every channel swimmer at present is entitled to swim the course in any way he or she chooses since there arc no rule, no channel swimming association liaving yet been formed. ‘At the same time the point raised is whether a swim assisted by aventitious aids such as the shelter of a tugboat la comparable with the unaided effort * of other swimmers who have succeeded. “Recording of controversial opinions, -of course, involving no aspersion on the bona fideness of Miss Edcrle's achievement” j At Empire TIKDCItItTI SSire AWIUUMfOa tUWCIIOfIi EMPIRE Whenever a dog and a cat meet there's bound to be a conflict.

JACKSON, A Negro Worker A great many Americans are very much concerned about Americanizing foreigners by inculcating in them the principles of Americanism. They need not worry over this matter', for “deeds” still “speak louder than words,” and occurrences like the Tulsa, Okalohoma race riot, the wanton murder of innocent and unoffending negroes, the general policy of oppression and repression and various other forms of injustice meted out to black men and women —and even to childx-en (with whom there certainly should be no quarrel)—furnish eloquent and edifying evidences, of the true nature of Americanism and cannot but be understood alike by aliens here and right-minded persons every, where. It is a curious commentary that white Americans are intensely interested in the prevention of cruelty to animals, but are not, in the slightest degree, concerned about stopping the murder of human beings—when such human beings are black. The whipping of a horse by its driver or the killing of a wild cat occasions an incalculable amount of protests, but the barbarous lynching or black women about to become mothers does not cause any consternation whatever. The case of Mary Turner, who was cfuelly murdered after being indescribably tortured, affords an idea of southern chivalry and southerners' vaunted respect for womanhood. Of course, it must be remembered that the negro is only regarded as a man in times of war, and that, otherwise, he is believed to be just a little more than a dog and quite a great deal less than a man. And at that, there are times without number when the dog is given the benefit of the; doubt. It must also be borne in mind that the negro is the only kind of game which may be hunted with impunity, any day during the year, on the happy hunting grounds or America. The lynching of negroes continues unabated, year after year, because it costs nothing to kill negroes. It is because of this that negroes who are members of the New Manhood Move ment —which is nothing more nor less than a Sinn Fein movement among negroes—have resolved to put a pro- | hibitive price pn lynching. When j white men are made to realize that f negroes are inexorably determined to J kill white men who may attempt to 3 ■ kill them, there will be fewer lynchrj ings. No‘man is so afraid of losing f i his life as that man who would reck i 1 lessly take the life of another. In . vain have negroes prayed and pleadij ed and tried every other peaceable r- means possible. And now, the policy - 1 of retaliation or direct action is the 3 only one which negroes can adopt if > ! self-respect and self-preservation > ■ mean anything < ttf them. Since so far as negroes are concerned, the Constitution of the Unit--5 customs receipts from Hawaii as a ed States, in the opinion of white ’ men and white women, is merely a ’ scrap of paper, a meaningless document, and since the government ac'j quiesces in the wholesale murder of ' its negro citizens and does not afford 1 , them any protection whatever, al- ' though it' spends millions of dollars ’ and employs a veritable army of 1 spies to enforce prohibition and thus ' attempts to regulate the beverages that Americans drink, negroes musi arm themselves and proceed to make good the declaration of the Constitution of the United States as far as it 1 affects their peace, their liberty and ' their happiness. As a natural outgrowth of the at- , titude of the government towards lawlessness of which they are the victims, negroes have developed a state of mind, which, when interpreted, takes this form: That a country which in times of peace cannot or will not protect its citizens at home is unworthy of SSfr patriotism and protection in times of war. . If black men can fight on the battlefields of Europe to protect white men and white women from the Huns of Europe, surely they can fight at least as creditably to protect their mothers, their sisters, their wives and their daughters, their lives and their limbs, their hearts and then homes from the barbarism of the Huns in America. So. and so only, i can negroes secure their fair and s full share 6f those rights and liberties which are not only guaranteed by ; the Constitution of the United States ; of America, but are unquestionably - the common heritage of all mankind.

We are in formed in less blazoned heads that the ambassador has offeree? ms sym- : pathy for the coolie bill. ' Then follows a three column book on Mr. Hammond’s declaration to the Bull reporter. We wonder at first what Mr. Hammond could saj)» in all that space, pertaining to the coolie question. After deep scrutiny we find that three lines —just three lines—-out of three columns are devoted to the ■ coolie question. A careful perusal of those three lines develops the interesting point that this lengthy discourse on the coolie bill is entirely equivocal—it can be construed either for or against the bill. Mr. Hammond says that public sentiment is - always right, in such cases. And the Bull plants a great headline to the effect that Ambassador Hammond supports “Ha waii’s bill”! It is barely possible—just barely possible—that \"the rumor of Japanese contributions, and the various other “statements” which are supposed to have been made by people who are not on the' ground to deny, issued from similar sources.

This is the most important point in the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the interests of this country. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years 75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Hawaii as a special fund to be expended in the islands for educational and public buildings, and for harbor improve* ments and military and naval defenses. It cannot be too often repeated aim must be to develop the territory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That territory has serious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but no measure of relief can be considered which looks to legislation admitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to field labor and domestic service. The status of servility can never again be tolerated on American soil. We cannot concede that the proper solution to Its prob lems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a class of laborers denit-d admission to the other States and Territories. There are obstacles, and great obstacles, in the way of ing a representative community in the Hawaiian Islands f\"but it is not in the American character to give up in the face of difficulty. Many an American commonwealth has been built up against odds equal to those that now confront Hawaii.

Jeanette Rankin Representative in Congress from the State of Montana Men and women, it is a great pleasure to meet a union at any time and j it is a special pleasure to meet a| teachers’ union, for we feel that the 1 wolrd is going to move if the teach-' ers will only become organized. Every man and woman in the United States is today thinking very ser-j iously. They are thinking seriously! of this great war and of democracy,! and we can no longer afford to think’ of democracy or to talk of democracy! without living democracy]; and when! we discuss democracy in govern-; ment it should mean something con Crete, it should mean certain steps that we are taking to make it possible for the people to have a voice in their government. We in the West have been thinking about democracy and government for some time and we have worked out certain steps, and each day we realize. more than ever' that democracy is not a real democracy unless it is based upon education. The press is the great educator 01 the masses, and it is on the press that we must depend for a certain amount of education for the masses. It is on the press that we must depend. for the facts o nwhich to base our judgments, and I believe it would rank first among the educators. Bui .through the ballot we have our plublie school system, and unless that public school system teaches the children to know what democracy is and to live democracy, it is going to be very hard for us to make the grown children live democ|acy, and unless the teachers who teach the children know something of democracy, it is going to be hard for them to teach the children, and I believe the teachers’ union is the first step toward teaching the men and women who are teachers in the schools to know what democracy is. . . .j . . . They have had nothing to’ say about what they should teach and: how they should teach it, and until j the teachers realize that they should have something to say about the con ditions under which they work and the way they carry on their work you cannot expect those tecahers to instil in the minds of the children a , real ideal of democracy and make them work for democracy on the outside. So I believe that our teachers’ union is one of the most essential steps, and that it is more essential now that we are talking of democracy that we maye make that ideal that we ‘are fighting for, that some are sacrificing so much for, a real ideal, one that we can live up to, that we may translate that ideal into life, and that if we are doing our part ! -we are going to work for democracy in away that is going to be effective. . . . And when the teachers have learned to express their feelnigs they are going to respect the right of the child to express its feelings, and if the child has gone through a school that is managed as an autocracy it is going to submit to autocracy on the outside, in government and in industry. So I believe that the very first step is for the teachers to make this demand, and it is not possible today for the'teachers to work alone. They must work with other teachers and they must work with all working people, and there is no reason why the teacher should not work with the bricklayer and with the stone mason. (Applause.) The conditions for the teachers are a little better than the conditions for some of' the other workers, simply because teaching is one of the first professions for women to enter outside of the home. Then we have had certain traditions that we'have not lived up to very well,! but still we talk a great deal about! the child and we consider that the child should have a certain amount of care. Of course, it does not go very far but it has gone far enough to make the teacher have a little bet-! ter social position. Yet it does seem to me that the teacher has not had very much respect when we consider the wages that the teacher has received and the tyranny to which most teachers submit, having so little to say about the general management of the schools. Unless wq train the children to want democracy and to live democracy, they are going to be perfectly satisfied with an autocratic government, and they are not going to make; the demand for democracy in indus-j try that is the vital question before 1 the American people today. For we are not anxious for democracy in j government merely for government as j an end in itself, but we want it as a means to secure to all the people greater opportunities, greater protection and greater freedom. Then we must have this democracy govern j ment in order that we may have democracy in industry, and that is the vital question before the Ameri can people today. . . . The Declaration of Independence yesterday meant self-government , Today it means self-employment. And we will hav edemocracy in industry-, it will come just as quietly and much more swiftly than the democracy in government which we. have achieved. And all this that we may have democracy in social life; and we will have democracy in social life when we have equal opportunity and equal protection and equal freedom, and the more nearly we approach equality in social life the more rapidly will we reach the time when we will evolve a race with the capacity for happiness and surrounded by the instrumentalities for enjoying life. Then e can feel, as well as say, not only, “I am as good as you are, but you are as good as I am.” I thank you.

Thus, Vice-President Spiro Agnew was the first io sound the call for an eventual journey to Mars. The venture to land an American on the moon has been a tremendously costly one. Since the late President Kennedy committed our nation to the lunar adventure in the early 1960's, Qyei\\$24 billion in Federal expenditures have been spent. IVFa^^i^ ar.gue, rightfully, that much of this money has created jobs for Americans in aerospace industries (in fact, a city like Houston, Texas just about owes its existence to the many industries which are located there). , The danger in pressing onward for further space exploration and its required expenditures should be obvious. Like the Vietnam war-this could mean a diversion of a much needed commitment from the solution of our urban and domestic problems. Perhaps, with an end to the war in Southeast Asia, we can afford money for both space and domestic needs. However, for Americans to look far off into the solar system and forget the decay of our cities, race relations, and environmental needs is to commit national suicide. Perhaps the same ingenuity and imagination which have gone into placing human beings on the moon's surface can be used in solving the problem of much-needed low cost housing. Though the latter problem may not be as exciting to many as a moon walk, it is for the immediate time, much more necessary and pressing that we achieve a solution. Furthermore, the air and water pollution and the frustration and the anger of Black Americans have demonstrated that we cannot afford the luxury of ignoring our domestic problems. It is not yet the time then, to rush hieadlong into calls for further space exploration without a close and meaningful look at priorities. A Challenge to Affluence The Government this week announced the Economic White Paper for 1969 in which it said that the time has come for Japan to launch a “challenge to real affluence.” in order to assure that the current business boom, continuing since October, 1965, would continue further. The report gave a long-range perspective of tasks confronting the Japanese economy with full attention paid to the rapid growth of the economy and progress of economic internationalization. The economic report, the 23 rd in an annual series, conducted a review of fiscal 1968, ended last March, and said the previous year was a year when the appreciation of Japan’s economic growth was further heightened in other countries. The white paper singled out six factors, including the heightened ceiling of balance of payments and emergence of an information age, as “new elements” buttressing the nation’s economic prosperity. Subtitled, “A Challenge to Affluence,” the voluminous 110,000-word paper emphasized the need for the Government to take a business policy based on balanced demand and supply and other equilibriums in the domestic economic scene. It noted that the requirement of the times were changing as a result of economic development and concluded that overcoming of the existing notions, systems and practices could lead to a “challenge to affluence.” The report noted that the policy founded on balanced demand and supply was essential The Hawaii Herald The cry for Black Power by Negroes is often looked upon by Japanese Americans as frightening and meaningless. It is looked upon as being justifications for riots and black racism and AJAs see it as being totally irrelevant as a political-economic tactic to achieve equality with white American society. A closer look at black power however, reveals it to be pertinent and relevant to the achievement of black equality in this country and very similar to the same road traveled by Japanese Americans in their very-near attainment of socio-economic progress. Black power’s basic tenets are these: -black people should have control of their own institutions such as schools and businesses. -blacks should be able to relate and identify themselves with black history and heritage such as their role in American history and African culture, through academic courses, customs, etc. A premise running throughout these basic tenets is the understanding that organizations and institutions which are working for black betterment or are concerned with the black people in America should be run by them and not whites. The reasoning is that the blacks are better to understand themselves and this kind of opportunity for leadership further bolsters their ability to participate in other World's Largest Housing Complex A new town claimed to be the world’s largest housing complex is rising outside of Tokyo. When completed, it will be home to 72,000 families, or about 400,000 people. That won’t be until the end of 1972, however. Right now, Tama New Town, as it is called, is an enormous pile of earth, swarming with hundreds of bulldozers preparing the land for building. Besides medium and high rise buildings, the housing complex will consist of parks, schools, shopping centers, amusement facilities and cultural halls. Two private railways in the area plan to connect their lines to the complex. Numerous banks and department stores plan to set up branches at Tama New Town as well. By Gary Doi areas. Japanese Junior Chambers of Commerce have fostered Japanese culture and advancement. And although Japanese language schools have become smaller and less popular in terms of attendance, they nevertheless served at one time as promoters of the Japanese way of life and cultural heritage boosters. The American Negro up until recently has essentially had no cultural and historical roots to relate to since he came here as a slave and generations have been treated as being outside of the white society. This has meant, Japanese Americans themselves have used a facsimile of black power in attaining their present position in America. Thus, many Japanese businesses have even to this day, consciously hired and promoted AJAs; organizations like Japan has for some time been a world leader in the factory manufacture of foods rich in protein. Such experimental products as chlorella have been shown to be commercially viable. Now for the first time, a Japanese concern has announced plans to establish a factory for the production of protein from petroleum. The protein made in this factory can be used to feed animals and fish. By next spring, 3,200 families should be able to move in as the town’s first residents. Tama is just one way Tokyo is trying to alleviate its severe housing shortage. Much more will have to be done before new residents will find it easy to live among the eleven million citizens of the world’s largest city. (Kyodo News) When the factory is half BLACK POWER COULD BE VIABLE Protein From Petroleum July 31, 1969 on the one hand, that he has been forced to accept the white society’s conception of him (as being inferior) and on the other hand, not being able to have any roots to go back to in order to understand his heritage and self. The number of institutions which he could relate to has been non-existent and he has been unable to progress economically and socially. (Added to this of coarse, is the problem of lack of political power because of Southern states’ policies of exclusion). Black power then, can be a viable and strong tactic to be used for socio-economic progress by the American Begro. It offers a way for blacks to assert themselves politically and can be a powerful stimulant for strengthening themselves and ultimately face white society as an equal, thus maximizing the chances for real integration. Arts And Cultural Festival Attention all art lovers! Grab your calendar and draw a red circle around the week of Aug. 5—8. Why is that week a red letter one? It's the week of the East-West Arts and Cultural Festival to be held at the HJCC Cultural Hall, 2454 S. Beretania St. Exhibits for viewing will include Japanese flower arrangements, bonsai plants, swords, meiseki (stone display), art objects, brass work and hand weaving. Displayed for sale will be beautiful paintings by Hawaii's outstanding artists, bonsai and \"ueki\" plants, sculptures, ceramics and Japanese dolls. There will also be demonstrations by Keiryo Kokubun and Bunkichi Yasumi in calligraphy and brush painting, and Yaeko Yoshioka, wife of the Consul General of Japan, will demonstrate the art of cloissonce. Certainly not to be missed is the Meiseki, a collection of unusual stones valued at $50,000. Scheduled every evening, 7—7:30, are stage presentations of Japanese classical dancing, kenbu, and tea ceremonies. The purpose of the festival, sponsored by HJCC, is to provide a medium through which local artists may present their works to the public for viewing and for sale, and to promote the preservation of the cultural heritage of the Japanese culture in Hawaii. The doors to the Cultural Hall will open at 10:00 A.M. and close 10:00 P.M. every day during the festival. Hope to see you there! completed in 1971, it will be producing at least $11.6-million worth of artificial protein a year. Production will be doubled two years later when the factory is completed. The secret of the whole enterprise is a tiny microorganism that feeds on paraffin. Its body is nearly all protein. The little mites will be harnessed by one of Japan’s largest chemical concerns, Dai Nippon Ink and Chemicals, Ltd., of Tokyo. Page 2"

Box 1290, 917 Kokea St. Honolulu, Hawaii 96817 Phone 852255 A Tribute to Settlers An event which received scant attention in Hawaii was recently celebrated in California. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first Japanese settlement on the continental United States. The Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Colony was short-lived and suffered a tragic ending; however, it was the first venture into agriculture by Japanese immigrants in the U.S. The contributions of later immigrants to California agriculture and history are still being felt. The first group of immigrants arrived from Aizu Wakamatsu, Japan, aboard the ship “China” of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, entering the U.S. on May 27, 1869, atSan Francisco. They proceeded to Sacramento by river boat, traveled overland by wagon to Placerville and Gold Hill, and eventually cleared land, build homes, and cultivated plants and seeds. The dry climate of the area, scarcity of irrigation water, lack of funds, and the failure of financial assistance from Japan doomed the pioneer project in less than two years. The immigrants sold most of their valuables. Some returned to Japan while others moved elsewhere for employment. According to research by Dr. Robert A. Wilson, director of the UCLA Japanese American Research Project (which is engaged in writing a textbook history of Japanese in the U.S.), only Matsunosuke Sakurai, a samurai, and Okei Ito, a nursemaid, remained behind at Gold Hill. They were befriended and employed by the early pioneer family of Francis Veekamp (whose descendants are still living in the Gold Hill area). Okei died at the tender age of 19 and Sakurai died in 1901. The story of the colony lay dormant until World War I when rumors persisted about a Japanese girl who died in the gold-rush period. It was discovered that 75-year old Henry Veekamp, son of the pioneer settlers, knew the story of the girl and the silk and tea colony. He poirfted out the site of the settlement and the location of Okei’s grave. Consequently, the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Colony was rediscovered. A Resolution passed by the California State Assembly provided for a monument,- bearing the State historical plaque^ which was dedicated on June 7 at Gold Hill commemorating the first settlers. It is a tribute, in part, to the memory of a brave group of people who courageously came to a strange and distant land in the hope of settling it.

The proposed mammoth incinerator will be able to dispose of one-fifth of this garbage and refuse. - The incinerator will be capable of disposing of 1,800 tons of garbage daily. Two turbine generators, with an output of 1,800 kilowatts, will be installed at the garbage disposal plant to utilize energy obtained from the burning of the garbage for power generation, heating and other purposes. 1 lid <: • liiiil utL ..slid The garbage disposal plant will be constructed' at “dream island,” a man-made island now being developed by Tokyo in Koto Ward. The Metropolitan Government, now conducting an The Hawaii Herald Thursday, June 26, 1969 Dissenting View Supporters of Status Quo Applaud Hayakawa s Stand By Gary Doi Deeply involved in the controversy over Hayakawa is the issue of what thS Japanese American’s role in society is. The chaotic political climate in California accounts for much of Hayakawa’s popularity. The backlash against both campus activists and black militants has recently been seen in municipal elections in Los Angeles and even in more sophisticated New York City. One would probably be accused of being a heretic or political radical if he were to express a dissenting viewpoint concerning S.I. Hayakawa. The simple fact that AJAs are a small minority of the American population means that they should support and identify with movements which seek to strengthen civil rights and opportunities for minorities. After all, any Japanese American who can become president of an American university and, during this turbulent period of student unrest, espouse a hard-line on campus activism, can expect to receive accolades from most people in this country. THUS, Hayakawa stands as an ideal individual for racist types to applaud. They cannot be -accused of racism if they support a non-white condemning black militants, can they? Indeed, the pictures on TV of an oriental standing up to long-haired youths and angry blacks must be reassuring to them. Hayakawa, unfortunately, stands as a symbol to many Americans of the yellow-skinned man who is anti-black and who says in effect, “Look at me, I made it without any crutches.” This has immense appeal to those who would thwart Negro progress and support status quo in race relations. Indeed, it isn’t very often that a Japanese American is mentioned as a potential candidate for state-wide office, even in California. HAYAKAWA, who during the mid-1950’s in lectures at the University of Hawaii summer sessions was calling on black Americans to “follow the Japanese American experience,” has become the focal point for the feelings of many in this country who are tired of studefit activism and Negro militants, including a fair amount of racists who would applaud George Wallace’s views on blacks. Too often have AJAs been unwilling to fight for racial justice in this country. Too often have Japanese Americans been able to say to themselves, “We’ve come a long way, let them do it our way too.” IT IS CURIOUS that Hayakawa’s voice was muted during attempts by AJAs themselves to assert their rights when it wasn’t “fashionable” to be an oriental. The most glaring example of this was his refusal to support the Japanese American Citizens League, a bulwark in the past and present, for the advancement of equal rights for AJAs. It is immoral to have this self-glorifying attitude-for the American Dream is not a reality until Martin Luther King’s dream of freedom and justice becomes true for all Americans.

Above, all, why should they be concerned about what action other powers might take, when it is up to Japan to make her own decisions? TOKYO--We have much to learn from studying the careers of Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582), Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536—1598), and Tokugawa leyasu (1542-1616) - who lived during the closing days of Japan’s civil wars. Japan was in too big a rush before the war, a feeling which seemed to pervade the nation - especially after the successful establishment of dictatorships by Mussolini and Hitler. The end result was tragedy, similar to that experienced by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. There are some points that we should bear in mind. Have the Soviet Union, Britain or France - who have already extended recognition — been successful in maintaining smooth relations with Red China? Nobunaga-a great leader, decisive and independent in his actions--bought law, order and unity to a turbulent Japan embroiled in civil wars. Hideyoshi had a dazzling career. He was bold and dashing; his achievements were brilliant and numerous. He, however, can be essentially categorized as a mere successor to Nobunaga. Even if Red China should be allowed membership into the U.N., there is still the great wall of China which bars the Chinese public from either mingling with the other people of the world or from knowing the true world situation. This kind of attitude is making a popular comeback in Japan again — one notable example is in extending recognition to Red China. 1EYASU was made of different timber. His actions, both in government and in the military field, were unostentatious compared to either Nobunaga or Hideyoshi. He followed Sun Tse’s philosophy of “those who win battles without fighting will have the most to reap.” There would be nothing strange if such assertions were made by Marxist adherents. It is difficult to understand why conservative elements, supposedly upholders of freedom, are raising the clamor. AS EVIDENCED by their long history, there is no question that the Chinese are a great people. There is, however, the added fact that they are among the most difficult to understand. This is aptly expressed by Admiral Tomosaburo Kato who said, “Not a single expert on China has been able to make accurate predictions about them.” THEIR CRITICISMS of Japan’s policy of playing “follow the leader” to the United States might possibly deserve some merit. On the other hand, why do they also assert that Japan must not lag behind Canada and Italy in extending recognition to Red China? Why do they fear that America might go over Japan’s It is often true that heroes end their lives tragically because of over-confidence and impatience to attain success, leyasu was an exception. We should take a careful and long-range view of the Chinese situation. (Translation by Mrs. M. Kawamoto) He was never in a hurry; his attitude was one of, “There is always the next bus if I miss this ” UI ' 'Jim <(.:»! we"

Box 1290 — 917 Kokea Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96817 MEXICO CITY (UPI)—The United States has increased its Olympic gold medal harvest to six and it’s due to win a lot more in the next few days. That’s because swimming events start today and the U.S. men’s and women’s swimming team is considered the best in the world. The Yanks picked up two gold medals in track and field yesterday. Tommie Smith won the men’s 200 meters in 19.8 sec-onds—breaking his O' v n listed world mark at 20 seconds. Bob Seagren took the gold medal in the pole vault. Along with two foreign vaulters. Seagren cleared 17 feet, eight and one half inches and was declared the winner on the basis of fe ,v er misses. The competition lasted seven and oneha'f hours.

U.S. Negro athletes had long planned some sort of demonstration to protest racism and they carried through last night after the running of the men’s 200-meter dash. Tommie Smith and John Carols, both Negroes, finished one-two in the race. When they received their medals in the traditional ceremonies, both raised clenched fists in the \"Black Power’’ gesture. Officials had been told beforehand that the demonstration would take place. Finals are scheduled today in two swimming events—the women’s 400-meier medley relay and the men’s 400-meter freestyle relay. The United States is favored to win both. In track today, America’s only solid hope for a gold medal is in the 110-meter hurdles. Leon Coleman of Winston Salem. North Carolina.

Spotter Steve Snider in New York says the Middies have a chance to score. Army earns the nod over Rutgers, though Rutgers always gets up for this one. Also, Princeton over Colgate, Penn over Lehigh, Villanova over Buffalo, Temple over Hofstra, and Delaware over West Chester. In New England, home teams are the choices in Ivy League games, but a couple of visitors are favored in Yankee Conference action. Yale’s unbeaten Bulldogs should win their 12th straight while hosting free-wheeling Columbia in the Ivy feature. Spotter Dick Dew in Boston says Harvard is the pick over Cornell and Dartmouth over Brown. In the Yankee Conference it’s New Hampshire over Maine and defending champion Massachusetts over Rhode Island. Also,, Boston University over Holy Cross in a mild upset and Connecticut over Maine. Southeast The Alabama Crimson Tide meets the Tennessee Vols on that Tartan turf at Knoxville Saturday—and you’ll be able to hear the leather popping for miles around. The unbeaten Vols and the once-beaten Tide have built their series into one of Dixie’s greatest classics. Tennessee’s offense has been gaining momentum since Richmond Flowers missed the Olympics and returned to duty. Alabama’s offense has been ques- ■ tenable. One thing—Alabama can’t complain about the artificial turf since that’s what the Tide practices on back home. But. considering the offenses and the home field advantage, spotter David Moffit in Atlanta picks Tennessee over Alabama. In other games: Auburn over Georgia Tech, Florida over North Carolina. Georgia over Vanderbilt. Louisiana State over Kentucky. Texas Tech over Mississippi State, qnd Clemson over Duke. Also, South Carolina over Maryland. North Carolina State over Virginia. The Citadel over Virginia Military, Richmond over Furman, West Virginia over William and Marv. Florida State over Memphis State. Miami of Florida over Virginia Tech on Friday night, and Tulane over Boston College. Although! most people in other parts of the nation are unaware of it, indep?ndeni Southern Mississsippi has been quietly climbing up the ladder to football prominence. We think the Southerners will reach new heights this week and beat the Mississippi Rebels in the sleeper of the week. Midwest Ohio State,, fresh from tumbling Purdue from the number one spot, takes on another Big 10 Conference foe, Northwestern. For the Wildcats it can't be any worse than the four previous contests inn which they bowed to Miami, Southern Cal, Purdue and Notre Dame. Spotter Wally Martin in Chicago says Northwestern is in for another loss, this time to the Buckeyes. Can Leroy Keyes be bottled up two weeks in a row? it’s doubtful. Tne Boilermakers, who skidded all the way to fifth place in the ratings, are the pick over WakeForest. Also, Notre Dame over Illinois, Indiana over Michigan, Michigan State over Minnesota, Iowa over Wisconsin and unbeaten Ohio University over Miami of Ohio. Midlands After losing to fourth-ranked Kansas last week, Nebraska must beat Missouri Saturday to stay alive in the Big Eight footoall race. The Nebraska-Missouri game figures to be a defensive marathon, with the Cornhuskers the pick by spotter Bill Osthoff in Kansas City. iu outer games, Kansas should have little trouble with Oklahoma State, Oklahoma is ' the heavy favorite over Iowa State, Cincinnati is the pick over winless Wichita State, and North Texas State is the choice ’ over Tulsa.

High Toll of Hand Injuries NEW YORK (UPI) — Disabling work injuries to hands and fingers account for nearly one of four industrial accidents each year, the National Safety Council reports. TOMMIE SMITH—Winner of the 200-meter dash UPI Telephotc Racial Issue At Olympics By JOHN G. GRIFFIN t UPI Executive Sports Editor MEXICO CITY (UPI)—The racial issue—symbolized by the clenched black fists of two of America’s greatest runners — rose today to further plague an Olympic Games that already had seen more than its share of troubles. The Games of the XIX Olympiad go on today at the various splendid sites in this Aztec capital with nine more coveted gold medal sto be decidedthree of them likely to go to U.S. athletes. But a new and dramatic page in Olympic history was written last night immediately followilng the dramatic triumphs of Americans Tommie Smith in the men’s 200-meter dash and Bob Seagren in the pole vault. It happened sud denly—though no one can say without warning—in the victory ceremony for the dash. Smith and his fellow Negro teammate, John Carlos, whom he had defeated, advanced to stand on the triple podium where Olympic medal winners are formally presented with their awards. As they stepped up, it could be seen that both were wearing black gloves—there have been hints all week that U.S. black athletes would wear something black as a symbol of their protest about what they consider injustices in the U.S. In addition, each wore on his uniform, over the “A” in “U S A.\" a button proclaiming “Olympic Project for Human Rights.\" Their medals were hung about their necks-by Britain’s Marquis of Exeter and not president Averv Brundage of the International Olympic Comr. ue, whom Negices have criticized. Then as the U.S. flag floated to the top of the victory pole and the “Stars Spangled Banner\" was plyed, there came the “demonstration\" Carlos promised days ago when the U.S. team first arrived. With chins sunk on their chests, both U S. blacks shot their clenched fists skyward in the “Black Power\"’ gesture that has become familiar in the United States. U.S. Olympic officials knew of the pair’s plans before the ceremony, an American Olympic press officer said The officer said the runners had told coach Payton Jordan, who notified Olympic officials. The officials chose not to In- terfere and were not expected to take any other action. Brundage chose this day to go to Acapulco where the Olympic yachting is held. At a news conference immediaely afterward, Smith said the gesture was made “to show blacks are united,” and he added, “we’re glad we did it.” Carlos said the gesture was made to show that “black people are not animals. \".If you think we’re bad,” said Carlos, “the ’72 Olympic Games are really going to be , bad. The black people who say they are going to boycott the Games are the ones who are winning the medals. Remember i this.” On that note the conference ’ ended — and the Olympic 1 Games.troubled in advance by a dispute over the altitude 1 here, then over the quuestion of South Africa’s banishment, ’ over violence in the streets ' in the days immediately preceding the Games, had its new ( problem.

Yet he teaches a black history course, has authored a book on black history, has adopted black and Puerto Rican children and lives in a predominantly black neighborhood. The assistant professor at the Camden branch of Rutgers University was completing the requirements for his doctoral degree at the University of California 10 years ago when he learned that Merritt College in nearby Oakland was seeking a teacher to institute a course in Afro-American Studies. Carlisle met the qualifications, having earned his bachelor’s degree at Harvard and his master’s at Berkeley, with emphasis on 20th century U.S. history. “I have had about six students who have been difficult to deal with,” he recalls. “1 would just listen to them and try to change their outbursts into a learning experience. Fortunately,” he adds with a smile, “time always has a way of running out on a class before things get too heated.” Nevertheless, these experiences have altered the 37-year-old professor’s thinking a great deal, he admits. His students have convinced him that black history should not be taught as a history of blacks who are heroic because of their contributions to whites, but rather as a history of black people themselves. That idea is the basis of his recently published book, “Prologue to Liberation: A History of Black People in America.” When he came to the Camden campus in 1969, the year black history was introduced as an academic subject, the students were predominantly white “This resulted in many uncomfortable moments for the blacks,” he says. “But as more black students entered the school the enrollment in both my sections has become more balanced racially.” The professor’s involvement with Afro-American studies was one factor in the Carlisles’ decision to adopt a black child. TEACHER-AUTHOR — Dr. Rodney P. Carlisle, assistant professor of history at the Rutgers campus in Camden, N.J., discusses his new book on black history with some of his students. and later a Puerto Rican child. “We were asked if we had any ethnic preference,\" the sandy-haired Carlisle explains “Neither my wife Ann nor I cared about the child’s background as long as the natural parents hadn’t specified a preference in the parents. When the agency asked if we wanted a black child my wife and I talked it over and we were both enthusiastic about the idea.\" So far the children — a 5-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl — have been too young to experience any unpleasantness as a result of the interracial adoption. \"I wouldn’t think they’d have any more problems growing up than any other minority children would have,” their father predicts. “Well just have to deal with the problems as they come up.” However, Carlisle admits there was some “curiosity” when the family visited Mexico last year. “Crowds would gather around and point to the children,\" he says, \"because in Mexico adoption is through families, not agencies. We just tried to explain the difference between the two countries' adoption systems. Some people understood and some didn’t ” Carlisle and his wife are the only white couple with an integrated family in the mostly black suburb of Lawnside, N.J “We were familiar with and liked both the development and the urban area nearby.” he says. “The neighbors have been very hospitable.” Carlisle, who also teaches U.S. history and Latin American history, has been active on local and university programs dealing with minority groups. He shares with his wife the hobby of collecting antiques and is especially proud of an 1865 rectangular grand piano which occupies a place of honor in their house. Meanwhile, his interest in black history has led him to begin work on a second book dealing with black nationalist movements. Rogers on Block September terrorists KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Diplomats, Sudanese officials and newsmen wept openly today as a U.S. presidential plane left Khartoum to take home the bodies and families of two U.S. diplomats murdered by Palestinian guerrillas. The burlap-wrapped bodies of U.S. Ambassador Cleo A. Noel Jr. and Charge d'Affaires G. Curtis Moore were carried from the blood-spattered Saudi Arabian Embassy on Sunday. The eight guerrillas surrendered to Sudanese authorities Sunday after holding out for 60 hours. In Washington today Secretary of State William P. Rogers asserted today he believed “the death penalty would be quite appropriate” for the Black September terrorists. \"I don't know any other way you can deal with this,” he told reporters in reply to questions. Rogers added, however, that this country was not trying to tell the Sudanese government what penalty to mete out to the eight terrorists who surrendered Sunday. Rogers conceded that the problem of supplying protection to U.S. diplomats around the world was a very difficult one. \"We can’t have guards for all our diplomats everywhere and everyone connected with them,” he said. “There just aren’t enough to go around.” He appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The secretary said he believed that, if the death penalty were not used, terrorists \"will continue to hijack planes and engage in these kidnapings.” Rogers said the administration is determined to do everything possible to protect American diplomats. \"I talked about this at great length with President Nixon yesterday,” he said. “He’s very upset about it.” The president of Sudan has sent a cable to President Nixon indicating his government intends to deal firmly with the eight Palestinian guerrillas. The government of Israel says the murder of three diplomats in Khartoum proves the aim of Palestinian terrorists is to torpedo all chances for peace in the middle east. The cabinet statement appealed to the nations of the world to take steps to wipe out terrorism. An anonymous guerrilla statement issued in Beirut, Lebanon ) The Arab world, as reflected in its press, displayed a marked lack of support today for the Black September guerrillas. Cleo A. Noel Slain U.S. Ambassador to the Sudan. says one of the three murdered diplomats, G. Curtis Moore of the U.S.—was a Central Intelligence Agent. The statement charges he helped plan the massacre of Palestinians in Jordan in 1970. weather Honolulu and vicinity including Windward Oahu — Lots of cloudiness and occasional showers through Tuesday. Gusty tradewinds of 15 to 30 mph today will diminish tonight and Tuesday. High today 81 and low tonight 70. Government-controlled radios and newspapers in Libya, Syria and Iraq continued to withhold comment. In the past, they have been quick to hail Black September operations. Egyptian newspapers all sought to blame Palestinian guerrilla violence on continued American military support of Israel but there was no openly expressed support for the Khartoum slayings. Arab World, a respected digest and analysis of Arab affairs said \"The Khartoum operation has sealed the fate of the guerrilla leaders who the Black Septemberists tried to save in Jordan.” King Hussein of Jordan Sunday night approved death sentences for the 20 Palestinian guerrillas, including guerrilla leader Mohammed Daoud Odeh, charged with plotting to kidnap Jordan’s Prime Minister Ahmed Lozi and overthrow the monarchy. I’he Black Septembrists, who surrendered, called themselves \"The Abu Daoud Squad” and made Daoud's release their No. 1 demand Most Beirut newspapers expected the guerrilla presence in Sudan to be sharply restricted. moon dust not volcanic WASHINGTON (AP) - That Orange Moon dust brought back by the Apollo 17 astronauts wa>. not volcanic after all. It’s made of tiny glass beads probably created by an ancient meteor. Astronaut Harrison Schmitt suggested, while gathering the strange orange soil on the Moon, that it might have come from relatively recent volcanic activity. Earthbound scientists hoped it would tell them something . about the seemingly cold Moon’s inner life. Scientist Edwin Roedder of the U.S. Geological Survey, says Schmitt's suggestion is a perfectly valid interpretation under his working conditions. But Roedder said close ex- amination in laboratories on Earth turned up characteristics which are very hard to link with volcanic activity but are easy to explain by meteor impact. The agency said the meteor responsible for the orange soil probably slammed into the Moon some three and two thirds billion years ago, instantly melting both itself and the lunar rock it hit. i The agency says: \"Resulting violent explosion sprayed this liquid out into space as very tiny droplets, traveling at high velocity and in part spinning rapidly.” ' The statement also said: “Most droplets cooled very fact, forming solid orange glass beads before they landed.” Deficit Largest Ever RELIGION IN THE NEWS Japan registered its largest monthly over-all balance of payments deficit ever in January, the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan announced last week. The $610 million deficit represented a drop of $812 million from the $202 million surplus for Dccembci.

Cornell AP Religion Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Old folks who have lived to advanced ages often are asked hw it’s done. To what habits or rules do they attribute their long life? They offer a potpourri of prescription, religious and otherwise. A collection of them was assembled in a recent issue of the Immortality Newsletter, a bimonthly roundup of antideath research and thought published in San Marcos, Calif. It reports there currently are about 12,000 Americans who have lived more than 100 years, and presents this sampling of some of their f ormulas for achieving such longevity: ‘ Believe in God.

In an effort to demonstrate public support for President Nixon’s position, the White House said there has never been unconditional forgiveness for draft-dodgers following any war in U.S. history. Since Nixon’s firm declaration at a news conference Jan. 31 that, “Amnesty means forgiveness. We cannot provide forgiveness for them,” several thousand persons have written or sent telegrams, the White House said Sunday. More are expected since Nixon reaffirmed his position in another news conference last Friday. stricter regs. for ad. agencies HONOLULU (AP) - Strict new State regulations covering private employment agencies are in effect. The new regulations set down new advertising guidelines aimed at preventing false or misleading advertisements. The rules also state that agency owners may not operate in conjunction with a collection agency, liquor establishment, loan company or in a private home. The regulations also revise the fee schedules. State Labor Director Robert Hasegawa said he hopes the rules \"Will more effectively promote long-term placements and encourage job seekers to stay on their jobs longer after being placed by the agencies.” Prairie Novel Gets to Basic Issue Of Problems, Heroics in America By EVE SHARBUTT AP Newsfeatures Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Katherine Morgan Ryan set her first novel on the Iowa prairie for two reasons: she wanted to use the beauty of the land as a background for heroics and she thought the people were not very different from other Americans. “The land is so beautiful and the smell of the rich, black soil so overpowering — it’s like a carbon filter cleansing you of the smog and noise and bustle of the cities,\" she said. “At night, the prairie is the loveliest section of the country. You can see scudding clouds, stars, the midnight blue sky and the land merges into that sky so that there’s almost no horizon. “My small town is not unlike a lot of small towns. It is an ideal setting for a novel that wants to go into depth,” she added. She tossed her streaked blonde hair, fingered the knotted gold choker necklace she wore, and added that she had tried to omit any mention of her famous writer husband in publicity about her book. “But then the publisher sent out a release saying I was the wife of Cornelius Ryan of World War II histories fame, so everybody knew.” Her husband is proud of her novel, she added. \"He works with bare bones copy in history, of course, so he said he’d like to add some of those lyrical, descriptive passages to his work. He can’t do it, of course. But it is frustra ting, editing his work, to tak( out all those adjectives and adverbs,” Mrs. Ryan said. She admires military men and says they have many traits similar to the Midwesterners she knows so well. “Most are dedicated. They serve their country with blinders on, never questioning their duty. The lowans I know are level-headed, slow to anger. There's too little written about the Midwest. Most people subscribe to the cartoonists theory of what it’s like.” The idea for a novel about Iowa had been with Mrs. Ryan for some time before she began \"The Betty Tree.” “I did 300 pages of a similar thing the first year I was in New York out of journalism school, but it had no design. It was just dreadful. Oddly enough, the idea has been in the back of my mind ever since,” she said. So this year, she worked every day from 8:30 a.m. until 6 p.m., when she went in to cook dinner for her husband and two children, 19 and 16. \"I work through because I’m never really aware of the passage of time. At the end of the day I sometimes feel I haven't done anything good, or that well, or that important. But it's just the way 1 work,” she said. Often when the Ryans are at work on a history, they break for dinner and go back for night work. \"I think people who free lance have to discipline themselves more,” said the former magazine editor. “You say to yourself, 'Why not go to just this one luncheon?’ At the office it would be automatic to say no just because you're working. \"When you’re free lancing you must say to yourself, ‘I am working, I have a job.’ You’re more severe with yourself simply because you’re on your own.” Mrs. Ryan said it is helpful that the office in their Connecticut home is built separate from the house “One must get up, get dressed and go to work. You can’t just wander around the house. You must physically get down there. It's a great way to get moving. “We have a marvelous setup for two people who work at the same profession. We need all the space in our large room Connie needs pacing space — he paces when he thinks. I usu ally sit with my head in my hands and wonder how I ever got into writing. We never run into each other,” Mrs. Ryan said. A native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, who studied at the University of Missouri school of journalism. Mrs. Ryan said everything in her novel depended on the first sentence. “I had to find the narrative tone I wanted to sustain Once 1 got the sequence of words right, everything fitted and flowed smoothly. It is hard for anybody really trained in journalism to start without getting the first paragraph right,\" she said. Her 19-year-old son is now a Missouri student while her daughter lives at home “I consider myself a Midwesterner, still,” she said. “But my son is an Easterner. He is amused and amazed by Midwestern accents. We had such a discussion at Christmas vacation — the air was blue.” Pokini trial delayed HONOLULU (AP) - The trial of seven men charged in the Oahu Sugar Company robbery last year tentatively has been rescheduled for March 27th. The trial was to have begun today in Circuit Judge Robert Chang's court, but it was postponed because of pre-trial motions and conferences among attorneys. Alleged gang leader James Pokini and six others arc accused in the $500 armed robbery at the sugar plantation office last April 28th. Pokini and two of the six defendents were convinced last week in the Liberty House jewel robbery last May 3rd. Members of the gang have been charged in a scries of murder cases last year.

The passport was handed to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, which provided Leary with an him to travel back to the United States. Leary’s escape from the men’s prison at San Luis Obispo was allegedly engineered by the radical Weatherman’s group. They took credit for it in an announcement to news media. He was serving his l-to-10 year sentence for narcotics possession growing out of an arrest in Laguna Beach, Calif., in 1968. After his escape Leary surfaced in North Africa and was whisked through several countries, seeking political asylum, before finally settling in Algeria with Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver. LONDON (AP) - Dr. Timothey Leary, former Harvard professor and drug advocate, was flown to Los Angeles today with a two-man escort from the U.S. Narcotics Bureau. Leary escaped in September 1970 from prison in San Luis Obispo County, Calif., where he was serving a 10-year sentence on a drug conviction. He was expelled from Afghanistan Wednesday. In the summer of 1971 he was arrested in Switzerland and later had to leave the country. Efforts by the State of California to extradite him failed, however. He also sought refuge in Algeria. Leary, accompanied by a friend, Miss Joanna HarcourtSmith, arrived by air from Kabul today. Earlier reports said Leary had been held under house arrest in the Afghan capital There is no extradition treaty between the United States and Afghanistan but Foreign Minis- try officials in Kabul said: “We want Leary to leave Afghanistan because we do not want to add to the country’s bad name in drug trafficking.” The Pan American World Airways jumbo jet carrying Leary in from Kabul arrived in midmorning. It was immediately boarded by British immigration officials, a U.S. Embassy official and the two Narcotics Bureau agents. A few minutes later they walked down the steps from the aircraft with Leary and Miss Harcourt-Smith. Leary wore an open-necked yellow shirt, blue trousers and soft white shoes and carried an overnight bag. His friend wore a fur coat and had necklaces over her blouse. As they made their way 300 yards to the immigration hall, Leary and Miss Harcourt-Smith were embracing all the way. Shortly before disappearing into the hall, Leary turned to reporters and said: “I’m goine There was an apparent falling out in which Cleaver allegedly placed Leary and his wife, Rosemary, under house arrest. Leary next surfaced in Switzerland. For more than a year, he attempted to gain political asylum in that country but was finally ordered out. Once returned to the United States Leary will probably stand trial with 46 other alleged members of a group called the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. A grand jury in Orange County, Calif., last summer indicted the members of the group, which authorities say is an internaI tional drug smuggling cult. । Leary is being sought on a $5 . million warrant for his alleged j part in the group. . The group purportedly was . formed in Laguna Beach six ; years ago and grew into a mul- . timillion-dollar conspiracy specializing in the smuggling of i marijuana, hashish and cocaine 3 and the manufacture and export , of LSD. KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) —The Florida White House and Hanoi jointly announced today that top-level Paris peace talks between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho will be resumed Tuesday “for the purpose of completing the text of an agreement.” Asked if this would be the final meeting of Kissinger and Tho. press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said, \"the announcement will have to speak for itself.” Ziegler also announced that Army Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., now in Bangkok as part of a Southeast Asia tour to discuss the Paris talks, would return to Saigon Saturday and meet again with President Nguyen Van Thieu. He said he did not knew whether Haig would retu n to Washington prior to Kissinger's departure. Slmillion damages sought A 32-year-old man who was seriously injured and whose daughter died in a nine-vehicle smashup involving a city refuse truck near Kailua Monday has filed suit for one million dollars in damages. The suit filed in Circuit Court by Richard Ahina names refuse truck driver Isaac Condon, the City, the State and a private trucking company as defendants. Ahina remains in guarded condition at Castle Memorial Hospital. His daughter, five-year-old Marvell Kunewa, was killed in the accident along with her mother, Francine Kunewa, and another woman. Ahina is represented in the suit by attorneys Stuart Cowan and Philip Frey. Police have reportedly found nothing mechanically wrong with the braking system of the runaway truck. The driver had told police that the truck’s brakes failed as he was coming down the Pali Highway and he therefore could not stop the vehicle. Judge Masato Doi has issued a restraining order which which places the truck under lock and key. That order was sought by Mr. Ahina. A hearing on the matter will be held January 23rd at 1:30 p in. in Judge Doi's Court.

CHANNEL CHUCKLES By Bil Keane 1-8 11 >W “I forget now — is a 509 o dirty oven rap or on upset stomach?\" I House opens with wrangles HONOLULU (AP) - The first day of the legislative session, usually reserved for ceremonies and entertainment, saw an almost immediate split in the Democratic majority of the State House. The split came as the representatives, in 27 to 24 votes both times, rejected two rules amendments. One was put forward by a group of dissident Democrats and the other by the minority Republicans. The significance of the split was viewed differently by the House leaders. Majority floor leader Charles Ushijima said he didn’t feel the factional fighting within the Democratic majority reflected any basic disagreement on issues. It was rather a matter of personalities. Representative Richard Garcia, considered a leader of Democratic dissidents, said the 27 votes backing speaker Tadao Beppu’s majority faction was a shaky foundation. But Republi1 can floor leader Joseph Garcia ’ said the combined dissident Democrat-Republican voting on - the rules questions did not sig- ( nal the formation of a coalition. The State’s fiscal picture highlighted addresses by the State House and Senate as the 1973 session of the State Legislature got underway yesterday. Both Senate President David McClung and House Speaker Tadao Beppu indicated they were against tax increases to solve a projected deficit in the state’s two-year budget proposed by Governor John Burns. Beppu said a tax increase would be “The easy way out,” but said it wouldn’t really solve the financial problem. Beppu said he viewed the present fiscal constraints as a positive factor addine that it will force the lawmakers to take a good look at the worth of existing government programs. McClung said the State must take a new look at social programs, particuarly welfare, to solve the financial crisis. McClung said one out of every four persons in Hawaii is on welfare, and the taxpayers are not just concerned, but are indignant. He stopped short of saying ' there would be no tax increase, but said the individual taxpayer ' is already shouldering perhaps ' more than his share of the load. By Dolores Barclay Associated Press Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Conceived in the late 1960s at the height of nationwide campus unrest and racial tension, black studies have secured a place in colleges and universities throughout the country. Now the question has emerged: How relevant are they to the black college student who soon will be out in the world, trying to earn a living? “Dashikis, a form of West African garb can't fire bullets when somebody’s trying to kill you, nor can they give people jobs, homes or food,” a turbanwrapped Columbia University coed said. An Associated Press survey of black studies across the country revealed the number of courses and students attending them were up at some institutions, down at others. The rhetoric was no longer so emotional. Community involvement had become important. Courses were broadening to include other minorities. But the key point of discussion among black educators and students alike was the basic value of black studies to the black student. At Columbia, black studies courses are interdisciplinary and include such topics as black culture in the United States, contemporary African politics, the development and organization of black family life in Africa, Arfican art and music and American urban history. Arthur Fletcher, executive director of the United Negro College Fund and former assistant secretary of labor, expressed the feeling that it is more vital for young blacks to prepare for the work force than to study such courses. \"Black studies are motivational,” he said. “Everyone wants to konw that he or she has a heritage, but one must do an analysis of where the jobs are first.” Kenneth Clark—black educaKohara Re-elected YBA President Arthur Kohara has been reelected President of the Young Buddhist’s Association of I lonolulu for 1973.

Officers will be installed at the YBA annual meeting and installation banquet on February 24. tor, psychologist and director of the Metropolitan Applied Research Center in New York —contends that black studies are “aid and comfort to segregationists.\" He feels courses in black history, culture and politics should not be separate from other academic disciplines. A different attitude was expressed by the director of one college black studies program. He posed and answered his own question: “What type of work can students do with a B A. in black studies? Teaching, poverty pro- grams, social work, h's preparation for all fields.” Although there is a considerable emphasis on Africa in many of the existing programs, the newest shift is broadening black studies into ethnic and minority programs. The University of Southern California has integrated black studies with Mexican-American and Oriental studies in its Ethnic Studies Department. With increased trends toward ethnic studies, some black students fear that budget allocations for black studies departments will be reduced sharply.

He is going to the award ceremony this weekend in Salt Lake City, Utah. En route back to Saigon, Hughes plans to stop in Key Biscaync, Fla., so foundation President Robert MacAuley can sign a draft agreement making the foundation a bonafide voluntary agency approved by the Vietnamese government. He explained that this will give the foundation legal status and tax exemptions and will enable it to write letters to get youngsters into school—or help them get identification cardi “so they can have an identity of sorts.” The youngsters are 9 to 16' years old.

The State Office of Consumer Protection has broadened its charges against an official of a number of car rental firms in Honolulu. Tiie agency earlier this month charged Mini-Cost Car Rental of Hawaii and its owner Sheldon Scosman with engaging in gross misrepresentation and overcharges for car rentals. Now the consumer protection office has charged seven other companies owned by Soosman with engaging in misleading and deceptive practices. Judge Masato Doi has set trial for the week of February 12th. At that time all eight firms named must show why they should not be stopped from continuing in the rental car business. The new charges are bolstered by additional complaints. An OCP spokesman alleges that the entire business practices of the defendant are conducted in a manner to defraud and deceive by employing various schemes, tricks, or devices to bilk the readers out of their money. Cable Cars for Kenya as Tourist Lure NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Tourists may soon be viewing wildlife in Kenya's Mt. Kenya region from the relative safety of cable cars high overhead. The cable cars would be the first to go into operation in an independent black African nation. An Austrian governmentsponsored report on the development of tourism in the Mt. Kenya and Abcrdare regions in the western part of the country has proposed the use of cable cars to open up the area to tourism Tourism, which brings in about 450.000 free-spending American. European and Japanese tourists every year, is Kenya's biggest single source of revenue. The report, at present being studied by the government, was prepared by Austrian tourism expert Helmut Senn, of Seefeld (Tyrol). who made an extensive study of the country's mountain areas. The report also recommended that a narrow gauge railway or a road be built in the Mt Kenya area. Austrian Ambassador Dr George Reisch. the man who is presently actively engaged in 'selling the cable cars plan to the Kenyans, believes that the Mt Kenya area offers unlimited prospects. As it is, the Mt Kenya National Park is attracting a growing number of visitors: 5,000 last year compared to 100 in 1958. Not all of them are mountain climbers It is for them that Senn wants to open up the region by a combination of all-weather roads, cable cars and a narrow gauge railway. He proposes that a cable car should cross the steepest part of the moorlands up to a height of 10,500 feet. As a continuation, he offers two alternatives: either a road three miles in length or a narrow gauge railway to the end of the Teleki Valley There a lodge for tourists should be built, Senn says. If desired, a turther cable car could be constructed from this lodge to Two Tarn Ridge at 14,850 ft . where a breathtaking view of glaciers and peaks present themselves to the visitor For the Aberdare Region, where the number of tourists has soared from 3,500 in 1958 to 40.000 in 1971, Senn suggests a cable car (up to an altitude of 9,700 ft.) which would result in a marvelous view of the Guru water falls 1973 KOHAKU UTA GASSEN NHK’s 1973 KOHAKU UTA GASSEN (Red and White Song Contest) will screen this Sunday on KHON Channel 2 from 11 am to 2 pm.

    "paragraphs": "Black Policemen Not Quite Equal By BETH J. TAMKE Commercial Appeal Writer MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — In the beginning there was the “thin grey line.” The men in that line 13 Negroes coined the term themselves. They felt they were white men with black skins. They reported to the Memphis Police Department, Oct. 11, 1948, for two weeks’ training. The events of L ittle Rock, Birmingham and Selma were still far in the future. The 13 knew one thing for certain: The police department did not want them. They were being “tried\" due to pressure from newspapers, and the precedent set by 51 other southern cities. Six of -the original 13 were accepted as patrolmen the first Negroes in the Memphis Police Department since the yellow fever epidemics of the 1870s. These early token Negro policemen worked under stultifying conditions. One of the first things they learned was bear up under white officers’ insults. They were warned not to arrest a white man: not to get in the way; not to \"loiter\" around the station; and to use their own dime if they wanted to report something to headquarters. Times have changed. There are now 83 Negroes among Memphis' 1,062 policemen. Black officers arrest w hite men. Squad cars were integrated in 1964. And blacks stand, not separately but with whites, at roll call. Friction between black and white officers is often overt here, but unlike many cities racial slurs do not lead to fist fights or drawn revolvers. Newsmen often hear white officers insulting their black colleagues sometimes to their faces. But the blacks expect this, and try to ignore it. “It's my attitude that makes me get along here,\" said a black officer. “I think I'm a man and it makes a difference. They treat me as one. Some of them make remarks, but I don’t pay any attention. I just walk out when they say something and I ignore them the rest of the time.\" mission study conducted in 1966 in Boston, Chicago and Washington found that 79 per cent of the white officers working in predominantly black precincts were prejudiced. Forty-five per cent of these white policemen were classified as \"extremely anti-Negro.\" At the same time 28 percent of the black officers expressed negative attitudes toward fellow blacks on the street. To a large extent the black and white officers have an equal image in the black community. Recently, a young black man shouted at a black officer. “Hey pig. Oink, oink!\" Retorted the policeman: \"I may be a pig, but I don't live in the ghetto.” Of the 15 Negro policemen interviewed, nearly all believe that their race hinders their chances for promotion. “I’m the best officer in the bureau and they know it,\" said a Negro detective. \"Maybe that makes them mad. I don't know. I took the lieutenant test four years ago, and passed. I'm still a detective. I probably won't take the test again. It's no use.” After three years on the force another black officer says he has no future. “Oh, they'll make a few showcase promotions, but we really don't have a chance,” he said. “It makes me mad, and 1 would say so if I didn’t have to depend of this job. I need it, and I'll do it. But 1 don’t have a future here and 1 know it. “Every morning I remember I’m a Negro. I go to work and I do my job. Sometimes 1 think about not getting anywhere and it affects my work. 1 get to thinking, ‘Why should 1 go out and break my neck when I'll only get a letter of commendation and it will be put in my folder.'

This does not include revenues from overseas. The fight will be telecast directly from ringside “live” not only to American locations but to many European, South American and Asian countries. It will also go into Canada and Mexico. The battle between Frazier, recognized by New York State, Pennsylvavnia, Masachusetts, Maine, Illinois and New Jersey, and the World Boxing Council, (which includes the Philippines and Mexico), and Ellis, the World Boxing Association champion, will resolve ownership of the championship for the first time since Cassius Clay’s crown was vacated by both New York and the WBA in April of 1967. Only once before in the modern era of boxing has there been such a dispute about the possession of the heavyweight title. When Joe Louis retired on March 1, 1949. several tournaments were held to produce a successor. Ezzard Charles won the National Boxing Association title by defeating Jersey Joe Walcott. New York would not recognize Charles. On September 27, Charles defeated Joe Louis in the Yankee Stadium to gain undisputed recognition as world diampioh. The contrast in styles of Frazier and Ellis makes this an intriguing fight. Frazier has a relentles, perpetual-motion attack. Ellis combines the skills of the master boxer with what has been probably the most detonating “sneak” right hand in boxing. Whereas Frazier makes his offence serve as his best defense, Ellis is more flexible and can adjust readily to the style of his opponent. He has both the speed and the experience to challenge any offense. Frazier, unlike other whirlwind punchers, is not strictly a “headhunter.” He mixes his attack to both the head and while he is not a pulverizing one-punch knockout artist, he wears his rivals down. What it will do against EHis remains to be seen. The Ellis body has never been severely tested as a heavyweight and Ellis has never been knocked out or even stopped. He has demonstrated ability to take a punch. On the other hand, a comparison with one common opponent — Oscar Bonavena — shows that Frazier’s chin can create an area of doubt. Bonavena had Frazier on the floor twice in their first fight on -September 21, 1966. and on Squires, Luis Angel Firpo, Rocky Marciano, Pete Rademacher, Roy Harris, Ingemar Johansson, Tom McNeeley and Cassius Clay were the others. Sullivan, Jeffries, Marciano, Johansson and Clay were successful. Ellis has been a professional fighter since 1951. Through 1964, he fought as a middleweight and was thrown against the toughest in the division with the problems of getting down to weight a constant menace. It was not until he joined the Clay troupe as his sparring paJiner that he began fighting in the heavier weight classses. That was in May of 1965, and after two successive lightheavyweight victories, he became a full-time heavyweight, winning all ten straight as a heavyweight and twelve in a row. On March 22, 1967, he emerged as a potential threat when he knocked out Johnny Persol in one-round on the Clay-Folley Garden card. In the Houston Astrodome, on August 5th, he began the series of eliminations for the WBA championships. He was the underdog against Leotis Martin and scored a 9th round knockout in a hard fought battle in which Martin suffered a very severe cut in his lip, which ended it. On December 2nd, he was brilliant and sharp in defeating Bonavena in 12-rounds at Louisville, having the rugged Argentine on the deck twice. On April 27, 1968, he won the WBA world heavyweight championship, beating Jerry Quarry in 15 rounds at Oakland. On September 14th. in Sweden, he defeated Floyd Patterson in 15. That was his last fight. He suffered a broken nose in the Patterson fight, which delayed his fbtum to action. Ellis has won 27 of his 32 fights, losing five decisions. He has knocked out 12. ; Mexican-Americans rap ; some video commercials f STAMFORD, Calif.

But, according to Thomas Martinez, director of the ; Mexican—American seminars at Stanford University, ail you’re doing is helping several of America’s largest firms contribute to racist thinking and stereotypes through their portrayal of Mexicans and Mexican—Americans. The gist of the commercial, says Martinez, is that Mexicans smell the most. The “spot” isn’t the only one shown, he adds. There are other firms advertising various products. “Advertising media that utilize Mexicans and Mex ican—Americans have selectively presented and exaggerated racial and cultural _ characteristics,” says Martinez. “The consequence is logical: an ethnic group is portrayed in a _ manner that renders esteem to ’ the values and beliefs of the If audience and, conversely, the ethnic group is perceived as ‘naturally inferior.’” )r Continuing, he adds: “TV II commercials and magazine advertisements symbolically ; reaffirm the inferior social status J of Mexicans and Mexican— Americans in the eyes of the audience. Exaggerated Mexican racial and cultural s characteristics, together with e some outright misconceptions t about their way of life, e symbolically suggest to the f audience that such people are s comical, lazy and thieving, who j want what the Anglos can have r by virtue of their superior taste j and culture.” The result is especially difficult on impressionable ’ youngsters, Martinez says in El t Grito, a journal of contemporary Mexican—American thought. j “Even unprejudiced parents, ’ of which there are few, are not t equipped to counter the steady I and subtle bombardment of , prejudicial suggestions that । advertisers conveniently । communicate to their children,” he says.

United Press International Stubborness proved a worthy virtue for Davidson coach Terry Holland last night. With his team trailing second ranked South Carolina 2919 at halftime, Holland, in his freshman season as head basketball coach of the Wildcats, instructed his players to stick with their orignal game plan. “In the first half, we got pretty much the shots, but we weren’t making them,” Holland nAed. “I told the players at the half not io go out and change our game plan. Wc had to be the smart ones. Our plan was to position well and not give them easy shots inside and f think we did that. The defense was tremendous.” The final result bore out Holland’s confidence in his plan as the 11th ranked Wildcats stunned the Gamecocks, 68-62, and handed South Carolina only its second loss in 20 games. Davidson, and especially sophomoit Brian Andrian, regained its shooting touch after intermission, hitting on 70 per cent of its field goal attempts in the 2nd half. Andrian, held to four points in the first half, found the range in the final 20 minutes and finished with 26. The Gamecocks, meanwhile, hit on only 38 per cent of their shots in the second half and went one spell of seven minutes without scoring Sou’h Carolina captain John Roche notched 34 points but the next Rookie Jo Jo Sparks Celtics United Press International And a rookie shall lead them. That may be the story for the Boston Celtics this season as the defending National Basketball champions were going nowhere in particular until rookie Jo Jo White was inserted into the starting lineup earlier this month. With White showing the way, the Celtics are making a belated bid for the fourth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Division and they moved another step closer to that goal last night by defeating the New York Knicks, 125-118, in overtime. White again played a major role in the Celtics’ latest triumph as he scored 26 points, including the basket that tie the score with only seven seconds remaining in regulation time. The oifginal play called for White to pass the ball to JAhn Havlicek but when the rookie frc : m Kansas saw Havlicek well covered, he drove for the basket and made the shot. \"I’ve played under pressure all my life,” White said referring to his crucial basket. \"Basketball is all I know. The pressure didn’t .iffect me. I just tried to get the ball up there and it hit.” Boston coach Tom Heinsohn called White the \"best passer Boston has had since (Bob) Cousy” and he added \"It might be 10 years before they get him out of the starting lineup.” White saw little action the first half uf the season because of a hitch in the Marinnes but he has come on to lead the Celtics who now I rail fourth place Philadelphia by four and a half games. Boston’s victory over New York made the Celtics the only club to beat the Knicks three times this season. The loss was only the 13th in 62 games for the Eastern Division leaders who played without starters Bill Bradley and Walt Frazier, who were sidelined with a sprained ankle and the flu. respectively.

COMMENTARY CANTON, China (UPI) U The current power struggle in China la * showdown battle between Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Vice Chairman Teng Hsia»ping. A major article appearing In the party newspaper, People’s Daily, made this clear, saying that Teng and his supporters still “have enormous power in their hands.” The article coincided with reports from Peking that wall posters attacking Teng had appeared outside college campuses for the first time.' The criticism of Teng, identified in the article as ‘‘that unrepentant capitalist reader within the party who clings to the revisionist line of Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao,” centers around three directives which allegedly subvert Mao's policy line. The main point of these directives is that stability and unity and development of the national economy are paramount goals—the “key link.\" Japan Quints One Month Old TOKYO (UPI) — Japan’s only quintuplets turned one month old today and were doing well at a hospital in Kagoshima, southern Japan, doctors reported. Their mother, Noriko Yamashita, held two of the quints in her arms for the first time before she was released from the Kagoshima Municipal Hospital today. Attending physician Dr. Hlsahiko Hokanighi told newsmen milk feeding tubes have been removed and all the babies, two boys and thrde girls, are doing well. Hokanishi said the babies will be kept in incubators for the time being. They now weigh from 3.6-4.S pounds, he said. The quints are the first babies born to Noriko, 28, and her husband, Yorimitsu Yamashita, 33, a political re-. porter for the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). They were bom Jan. 31. Noriko held the eldest son, Fukutaro, and eldest daughter, Hisako, before her departure from the hospital. The three others were sleeping in incubators. Noriko told a news conference at the hospital: *'I finally came to realize. I’m a mother when I held the two babies. They now look more like babies than when they were bom.” Three Escape From Stale Penitentiary Three State Prison inmates —two considered “very dan-gerous”—escaped yesterday and were still at large today. One of the prisoners is twice-convicted rapist Masao Okamura, who was also free for 25 days last October after escaping through the prison administration building. Officials say that’s the same route used yesterday. Another is Craig Grahovac, who is serving from 14 to 85 years for seven robbery-re-lated crimes. Thq third man is Lawrence Torres Jr., a convicted robber. The three men were present during an 11:15 a.m. head count. But by a 4:30 p.m. count, they had disappeared. A prison spokesman said Okamura and Grahovac are “extremely dangerous; they’re not schoolboy criminals.” The man apparently went through the prison visitors’ lanai, then through a room used by parole officers, down a hallway, and out It gate on the Waikiki side through the same door that Okamura had picked open during his previous escape five months ago. “They evidently had heavy equipment,” the spokesman said, noting that two heavy gate locks were completely removed during the escape. \"Dur great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: ‘what? taking the three directive as the key link? Stability and unity do not mean writing off class struggle. Class struggle is the key link - and everything else hinges on it,’ ” the article said. The article accused Teng, who also is a vice premier and had been expected to succeed Chou En-lai as premier, and other \"unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party” of plotting “behind the back of Chairman Mao and the party central committee.” ' The criticism of Teng also must be regarded as a criticism of Chou since the late premier set or endorsed the policies pursued by Teng since he was restored to power in 1973 after being purged during the Cultural\" Revolution. In addition to his posts as one of the three party vice chairman, a member of the political bureau and vice premier, Teng also was acting chief of the armed forces general staff when he first came under attack. This could have been what the People’s Daily article was referring to when it said, \"since the capitalist roaders within the party have enormous power in their hands, their brand of revisionism is very ferocious, intense and most dangerous.” It said the struggle would be long and intense. The article said Teng and his supporters were “making speeches,” “writing anonymous letters,” “spreading rumors” and \"playing an eclectic trick” by distorting Mao’s policies. “This method is not an invention by the unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party, but is an old trick used by both modern and old revisionists,” it said. Referring to Teng’s purge during the Cultural Revolution, the article said “his bourgeois character has not changed, and he cannot be depended on never to try to reverse previous verdicts. “Now, he is braying: ‘how can we taflt' about class straggle everyday?’ ” the article said, citing his opposition to the most basic Maoist doctrine, that class struggle must never cease. NY Yankees’ Owner Is Reinstated NEW YORK (UPI)-Base-ball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn today reinstated George Steinbrenner, primary owner and chief executive of the New York Yankees, following a 16-month suspension. Steinbrenner was. suspended by Kuhn in November, 1974 after he was indicted on charges of contributing illegally to the 1972 reclection campaign of President Nixon. Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to the charge. He was fined 315,000 and his company, the American Ship Building Company, was fined $70,000. The suspension was originally supposed to last two years but in announcing Steinbrenner’S reinstatement, Kuhn cited reasons for allowing the Yankee executive to resume his duties. “No. 1, my November, 1974 decision placing Steinbrenner on the ineligible list for two years was designed to assure public confidence in the integrity of professional baseball. I thinks that purpose has been achieved,” Kuhn said in a statement. “No. 2, nearly two years have elapsed since April, 1974 when Steinbrenner voluntarily removed himself from the daily affairs of the Yankees.

(UPI Photo) President Ford Says He’ll Win In All 50 States November 2nd WASHINGTON (UPI) - President Ford already is looking forward to November when, he says, he’ll win all 50 states, but most presidential candidates are concentrating on closer targets — Massachusetts’ primary Tuesday and Florida's nextweek. At the wind-up of a two-day ' campaign trip to Florida yesterday, President Ford says he will win all 50 states in the November election and hints that Ronald Reagan should drop out of the primaries if he loses in Florida. At a rally Ford declared: “We are going to win the election in November in all 50 states,” a feat never accomplished by a presidential candidate. “Florida is really the key,” he told campaign workers. “If we can win in Florida and win big they (the Reagan forces) ought to know they can’t win.” Ford and Reagan are on the ticket but neither has campaigned, and in Vermont where Reagan is not on the ballot. Both those primaries are tomorrow. The Florida showdown is a week later. Reagan had gone home to California for a couple of days’ rest when Ford made his sweeping claims of vic,tory — in the Florida primary and in the general eleb.tion. Some Democrats campaigning in Massachusetts were having a battle of endorsements: U.N. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan is for Henry Jackson, farmworkers’ chief Cesar Chavez and singer Roberta Flack were campaigning with Sargent Shriver, Morris Udall leaned heavily on endorsements by former Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox and House Democratic leader Thomas O’Neill, who is highly popular in his home state of Massachusetts. Brich Bayh said on television he did not think there would be “a clear-cut verdict in Massachusetts” and indicated he would be the “fellow on the dance floor at the end of the marathon.” Jimmy Carter, Democratic frontrunner by virtue of his win in New Hampshire, campaigned in Florida. He also picked up strength in Oklahoma County caucuses and finished virtually even with George Wallace in South Carolina precincts., Carter jumped from 17.89 per cent in the Oklahoma precinct caucuses three weeks ago to 28.98 per cent in the caucuses Saturday. Fred Harris, an Oklahoma native son, stayed at approximately his original level of 17.89 per cent. Party officials said Carter had picked up some previously uncommitted delegates to make the difference. George Wallace, the other southerner in the race, returned to Florida for “downhome cracker welcomes” in Lake Wales, Okeechobee and several shopping centers. Udall told interviewers on CBS-TV’s “Face The Nation” he wants to “take Jimmy Carter on one-on-one” but \"first I’ve got to get rid of some of my friends — Birch Bayh, Milton Shapp, Sargent Shriver and Fred Harris.” Black English Is Not Wrona; It's Different By BRUCE E. HICKS HOUSTON (UPI) - If a black child says “foe” instead of “four” he’s not wrong. He is speaking Black English, which has different rules from standard English, says Dr. Susan Houston, a specialist. He knows why he’s saying it that way, she said. “He’s not making an error. He’s just speaking Black English.” Ms. Houston is a specialist in socio-psycholinguistics at the University of Texas Speech and Hearing Institute. She said nine years of research show really few differences between Black and White English. Both are variations of the same language, she said. “England has much worse variations in English than we do.” The difference is in the phonology, br sound systems. The rules of pronunciation vary. It’s like comparing a Brooklyn accent with that of backwoods Florida, she said. Problems arise when a teacher can’t cope with Black English and decides it is wrong. “All black children I have ever met have a perfect undrestanding of White Eng- — — lish,” she said. “No child is going to do well when a teacher thinks he’s fundamentally retarded or something’s wrong because of his language. “In any situation which is constraining, the language they use is not a true example of what they can do. They are uncomfortable, uneasy, because they know people are watching. Children will use short sentences when they can get away with it and won’t talk much when called upon. They won’t express themselves much because they feel they’ll be censured if they do. “A child can tell when his behavior or language turns off a teacher, and when it does he won’t want any more attention than necessary.” Ms. Houston said children learn any form of a language to which they are exposed. Differences between White and Black English lessen as a child becomes more exposed to the world, even through television. She said most black children also have what she calls two “registers” of language, one for school and one out of school. She said an unenlightened teacher can make a child clam up, That teacher may believe the child is slow, dull or mentally deprived when he is just reacting in a self-pro-tecting way to his environment. Black children also are more peer-oriented and less concerned with teacher approval than peer approval, she said. In one study, she told black and white children a story and had them repeat it to a peer. “The white child would concentrate on the details as they were told then, and the black child w*as motivated to put more individual style in his work,” she said. “If a black child is asked in class to' tell what a story was about, he might be more tempted to embroider, the story, motivated by creativity, than to just give the facts, and a teacher might mark him wrong for it. That’s what’s wrong, not his way of telling the story.” Although Black English should not be a problem, she said, it too often is used as the excuse. “If it isn’t that, a teacher who can’t cope with a racially mixed class will j” t find Hawaii TOtt* Weather Forecart 1 Some showers tonight.

PRICE 15 CENTS Ford Won’t Meet Nixon To Hear His China Report WASHINGTON (UPI) - The White Howe today repeated Ito \"call-ue-we-won't-call-you\" attitude toward getting any report from former President Richard M. Nixon on his China visit. Press secretary Ron Nossen told reporters that President Ford has \"no plans\" to contact or talk to Nixon who returned from a nine-day China visit that Included more than nine hours of conversation with Communist Party Chairman Mao Tsetung and the new acting premier. \"If the fomer President thinks he has something to report,\" Nossen said, he can contact the State Department. Nossen voiced no criticism of Nixon making the trip but his words showed no White House enthusiasm for any contact with the pardoned ex-President. When a reporter suggested the government should be especially interested in any American who has talked so long with Poking leaders, Nesson said, \"lots of private citizens come back from trips overseas.\" Nossen also said Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger \"does not plan to see Mr. Nixon\" on a current trip to California. He said Nixon has not called the White Houm. LOS ANGELES (UPI) - Former President Richard Nixon returned home last night, ending a nine-day visit to China that drew honors from Peking’s leaders and cheers from thousands of Chinese, but generated criticism in the United States. Nixon’s plane, the same Chinese-owned Boeing 707 he departed in landed at Los Angeles International Airport at 5:32 p.m. His daughter Tricia Cox and about 40 reporter were on hand when the former President arrived with Mrs. Nixon and an entourage of aides and Secret Service agents on a cold and dismal evening, beneath a rain-threatening sky. Communist Chinese leaders, who invited Nixon to mark the fourth anniversary of his historic visit to bring about a thaw in Sino-Ameri-can relations after more than 20 years of hostility, gave him an even more lavish reception than he received as President. He was closeted for 1 hour and 40 minutes with Chairman Mao Tse-tung an honor usually reserved for visiting heads of state, and tens of thousands of cheering Chi- nese hailed him in the streets of Canton. At home, critics said he played into the hands of a Chinese plan to embarrass President Ford just before the New Hampshire primary —renewing in voters’ minds Ford’s connection with Nixon’s resignation in disgrace and pardon. Ford, who managed the narrowest of victories'over Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, has said he believes the Nixon trip probably did hurt him. Sen. Barry Goldwater, a former Nixon supporter, accused Nixon of breaking a federal law against private citizens conducting foreign relations, and said that if he wanted to do the country “a favor he might stay over there.” Nixon’s phlebitis, a circulatory ailment in his leg which almost cost him his life two years ago, flared up again in China. w He was limping noticeably by the end of his three-city tour and given anticoagulant pills by a navy medical corpsman who usually stays at his San Clemente seaside retreat. His concerned Chinese hosts assigned a Chinese cardiologist to accompany him and an ambulance to follow the Nixon entourage. Diet Hearing Getting Nowhere In Probe Of Lockheed Coro. Bribes TOKYO (UPI) - Twelve hours of witness-grilling by the Japanese Diet today shed little light on the $12 million in bribes allegedly paid by the Lockheed Aircraft Corp, to bolster its sales in Japan. Five business executives, including a naturalized American of Japanese descent, who testified under oath, denied any knowledge of Lockheed payoffs. Two witnesses — President Tokuji Wakasa of All Nippon Airways (ANA) and his predecessor, Tetsuo Oba — presented conflicting statements and were caught in a face-to-face showdown at the end of the marathon hearing before the Lower House Budget Committee probing the Lockheed scandal. Oba, an aviation expet, was the fist to testify and said he had optioned the McDonnelDouglas DC10 before he resigned as ANA president in 1970. “I was most seriously concerned about the option I hid taken and it was the only one of all that I handed over to Wakasa when I resigned,” Oba said. He said he chose the DC-10 after assessing various factors, including safety and maintenance requirements of his airline. Wakasa disputed Oba’s statement saying the Douglas aircraft was still in the designing stage at the time and “it is unconceivable” that any airline would have taken an option on it. Wakasa said he heard nothing of the reported option from Oba when he took over as president of ANA. Toshiyoshi Oni, 54, manager of the Lockheed Tokyo office, testified that he knew little of the affair because he is simply an office manager and his duties are chiefly supervising the work of his staff. His observation that his office ceased functioning when something else. People say we' need to teach the black kid to speak like avid Brinkley so he can get a good job. But if he spoke like David Brinkley and the employer didn’t want him to have the job, he wouldn’t get it anyway.\" his superiors were not in Japan brought laughter from lawmakers. Oni admitted he arranged a meeting between former Lockheed vice-chairman A. C. Kotchian and former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka when Tanaka was minister of international trade and industry. He said he acted as an interpreter but no discussions were held on Lockheed’s Tristar jetliner at the meeting. Hiroshi Itoh and Toshiharu Okubo, former executive directors of Marubeni Corp. — a major trading house and Lockheed’s agent in Japan — repeated answers they gave in the first two-day hearings held two weeks ago. They admitted signing receipts with such code-names as “peanuts,” “pieces” and “units” at the request of Lockheed representative J. W. Clutter but denied they received any money. Today’s hearing was a fol-low-up to the Feb. 15-16 round in which seven witnesses, including Kenji Osano, the hotel tycoon, and officials of ANA and Marubeni, testified. TOKYO (UPI) - Taro Fukuda, one of the key figures in the Lockheed payoffs scandal, has resigned as president of Japan Public Relations Inc. (JPR) because of poor health, the company announced today. The JPR in announcing Fukuda’s resignation as of Feb. 25 said Robert Bowen, executive vice president of Hill and Knowlton International, JPR’s parent company, will take over the post. The announcement said “Fukuda, who founded JPR in 1958 and which was acquired by Hill and Knowlton in 1972, has been ill and hospitalized for several months.” The 50-year-old Fukuda declined because of illness to testify before the Lower House Budget Committee of the Diet today in the second hearing on the Lockheed payoffs scandal in Japan. JPR was established in 1958 when the Lockheed Aircraft Corp, initiated a drive to sell its aircraft in Japan. Fukuda is believed to have served as an interpreter in talks between Yoshio Kodama, an ultra-rightist and a secret agent of Lockheed in Japan, and executives of the Burbank, Calif.-based company. Fukuda was hospitalized for. treatment of a liver ailment Feb. 7 following disclosures by a U.S. Senate Subcommittee that Lockheed paid $7 million in influence money to Kodama.

At the end of the war in April, 1865, Confederate money became worthless. The city managed to scrape up some U.S. greenbacks, but salaries of city employes were drastically reduced. The city marshal had a salary of $5,000 a year in Confederate money but received only $1,400 in green- ‘ backs. ■ & MONDAY (P.M.) 5:55—News 6:00—Doctor Chung’s Tips On Mental Health 6:15—Interview Comer 6:30—Kikaida 0-1 7:00—The Brave Raideen (Yuusha Raideen) 7:30—Cooking Show 8:00—Nippon No Uta 9:00—The Mysterious Bridge (Mishiranu Hashi) 9:55—News 10:00—Okubo Hikozaemon TUESDAY (P.M.) inimniimiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'iiiiiiiiiiit 5:55—News 6:00—Stars Imitate Stars 6:30—Naris Beauty 6:45—Local News 7:00—Doterai Yatsu 8:00—Dokkan To Ippatsu 9:00—Toshu, The Samurai Doctor 9:55—News 10:00—Okubo Hikozaemon"

By PEACE MOFFAT AP Newsfeatures Writer NEW YORK (AP) - \"Black women have been doubly oppressed,” says Dr. Gerda Lerner, a history professor who spent four years uncovering the history of black women. \"They have shared in the oppression of their race, and they have shared in the oppression of women. \"But their history is not one of victims. It is a history of achievement against great odds, of community and institution building, of sharing in the fight against race discrimination and of many outstanding individuals.\" Dr. Lerner, who teaches at Sarah Lawrence College, has written a 630-page book, \"Black Women in White America,” as the result of her research. The documentary history for the most part lets black women speak about their past for themselves. Why would a woman who is not herself black devote so much time to this project? “No black woman had happened to do it,” Dr. Lerner replies. She says she plans no more books on the subject, but that she hopes her book will be a foundation on which the history of black women can be built. “When I began researching I didn’t know if I’d find much documentation,” the historian says. “Everybody told me I Dump Opponents By The Associated Press The Eugene Emeralds have jined the Albuquerque Dukes widened their first place lead in the Eastern Division of the Pacific Coast League.

One such settlement house is the Neighborhood Union in Atlanta, which Dr. ; Lerner says has served the । community for over 50 years. । During the days of slavery, । black women had many ways of f educating themselves, ranging from eavesdropping when the daily newspapers were being read in the homes where they worked to setting up \"midnight schools” that met from midnight until 2 a.m. “Black women shared the oppression of all slaves,” Dr. Lerner says. “But in addition they were exploited as breeders of slaves and as sex objects of white men.” Since slavery. Dr. Lerner says, in a society m which we have assumed woman’s place is in the home, black woman’s place has been in the white woman’s kitchen. To many black women, liberation means being in their own kitchen supported by their own men ” Three Games Tonight mree games are ’ scheduled for tonight in Hawaii Mhjor League baseball The University of Hawaii, the league’s defending champion, will play the Hawks at 7 p.m. at Pearl Harbor’s Quick Field.

CHANNEL CHUCKLES By Bit Keane t / ir= —i \",. .So, if you see this thumb print, report it to the police or your local FBI office .immediately.\" SiKSal “You Dirty Crook!\" Baseball umpires and football referees take it in stride. But there are times when the cry “You dirty crook!” —or words to that effect —can amount to W~—*-> I l ^H f SA h y ;yi\"! ^\\’ S®r7 . slander. How the courts look upon such outbursts tells a great deal about the law of defamation of character. Take this case: During an argument at a golf course, one player called another “a lousy crook.” The latter filed suit for slander, charging that the epithet had branded him as a common criminal. But the court disagreed. At least in this situation, said the court, the words were no more than generalized bluster. Oliver Wendell Holmes once expressed the law’s attitude as follows: “A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought, and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.” Accordingly, another court found it was indeed defamatory for a jeweller to say of a rival jeweller that he was “a crook . . . mixed up in some crooked deals.” This time the comment, made during a business conference, was clearly meant to be taken literally. Even in a non-business setting, this kind of language may be defamatory. At a club meeting, one of the members denounced the club president as “a cheat and a fraud.” In short order, the president filed suit for slander. In a court hearing he pointed out that the remark had been made not merely as a general insult but as a specific comment on his performance in office. The court decided that, since the office was one of trust and honor, the words were weighty enough to support a suit. “Those words,” said the judge, \"cannot but impair confidence in (the president’s) ability to hold the office.\" An American Bar Association public service feature by Will Bernard. © 1972 American Bar Association AQ REVENUE UP IN MAGAZINES NEW YORK (AP) - The first four months of 1972 saw magazine advertising revenue up 8 per cent over the same period a year ago, according to the Magazine Publishers Assn.

WSPAPE 1 fired general ordered N.Vietnam bombinas By JIM ADAMS Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - An ousted U.S. commander in Vietnam confirmed to congressmen today that he ordered possibly unauthorized air strikes against the North Vietnamese for the safety of his pilots “and at the same time trying to stop the buildup\" that led to the incursion into South Vietnam. But retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John D. Lavelle said he ordered the strike halted March 10 when he learned three reports of the strikes had been falsified, and there ap- peared to be no way to continue them without filing false reports. Lavelle testified before the House Armed Services investigating subcommittee. Gen. John D. Ryan, Air Force chief of staff, told the subcommitee he fired Lavelle as commander of the 7th Air Force in Indochina when he learned of what he said were 28 unauthorized air strikes Air North Vietnam involving 147 planes. Lavelle said he thought there 1 were less than 20 such mis- ’ sions. i Lavelle said his pilots saw and photographed massive buildups of North Vietnamese planes, tanks, artillery and supplies near the demilitarized zone and said that when he rethem he did not receive it but neither did he receive a denial. Lavelle said he could understand Ryan’s viewpoint from Washington that “I had exceeded my authority.” But he added: “At that time as the commander on the spot concerned with the safety of the crews and at the same time trying to stop the buildup that was going on, I felt that these were justifiable actions.\" FAMOUS : AUTHOR DEAD BOONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Critic Edmund Wilson, a leading figure on the Americ literary scene for the past half century, died today of a heart attack at his home near this Adironack Mountain community. He was 77. He was author of more than a score of volumes of literary criticism, social comment, fiction and verse. His last book, “Upstate: Records and Recollections of Northern New York,” was published last August and described the people and places around his family home in the small hamlet of Talcottville, near this village north of Utica. Among his more noted works of criticism were “Axel’s Castle,” published in 1931, “Classics and Commercials,” published in 1950, and “The Shores of Light,\" published two years later. Wilson received many prizes and in 1963 was one of 26 living Americans to be awarded the Medal of Freedom by President John F. Kennedy. The medal is the nation’s highest civilian award for accomplishments in peaceful pursuits. He served as book review editor for the New Yorker magazine from 1944 to 1948.

TOKYO (AP) - Presidential adviser Henry Kisinger was asked by a Japanese reporter in Tokyo today to justify U.S. actions in bombing non-military targets and dams in North Vietnam. Kissinger said there was no truth to reports there had been deliberate bombing of civilians or river dikes. If any such incidents had happened. Kissinger said, they ware by accident not a question of policy.

Secretary of the Interior Rogers C. B. Morton announced earlier this spring that a free permit system for back-country travel and camping will begin on an expcrimenlal basis in June at Kings Canyon Nalionai 1’ark in California, Rocky Mounlain NalionnlT’ark in Colorado and Great Smoky Mountains Nalionai Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. .Secretary Morton emphasized that the pilot program concerns Four Supreme ■ ■ Court 4 1 Illite i Decisions' JlM : Racist Clubs can Bar Black Guests The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right of a private club to bar blacks as guests. The decision was six to three in a case involving a blad: Pennsylvania legislator tA^n to the Moose Lodge in Harrisburg as a guest. It did not involve the Moose ban on nonwhite members. The black, Leroy Irvis, ar- - gued that the club could not ex- elude black guests because it held a state liquor license. The majority opinion by William Rehnquist argued that states also provide such services as electricity, water and police and fire protection. And he said that to invoke the constitutional amendment equal protection of the laws ir such a situation would emasculate the distinction between private and state conduct. t Protestors on Military Bases ’ HONOLULU - A U.S. Supreme Court decision today may affect the military in Hawait in its method of dealing with anti-war demonstrator who distribute pamphlets on tnili-l ’ tary bases. ] r : The sureme court ruled that ’ . military - base commanders < J cou'd not exclude persons dis- [ tributing pamphlets from parts i . of their bases any more than* they ccu.'d exclude any member of the general public. A spokesman for Hickam Air Force Base, where 2) persons have been evicted from the base for handling out anti-war pamphlets thus far this year, said the effect of the decision wasn’t immediately determined. He said how the court’s ruling is to be interpreted will be determined by the Pentagon. Repossession of Merchandise Consumers who buy on credit ! - were declared today to be en- 1 - titled to advance notice and a : j hearing before a neutral offi- 1 5 cial in advance of any repossession of the merchandise. 5 The U.S. Supreme Court as- 1 » serted the right in a four to ! > three decision invalidating * t Pennsylvania and Florida laws. { ; It is seen as having wide- I spread implications because most states authorize automatic seizure of goods if a purchaser falls behind in his payments. Justice Potter Stewart said for the majority that reposession without safegaurds for the consumer would violate 14th amendment provisions for due process of law. f Pinh* tn fnnncol i ixiyni iu > WASHINGTON (AP) - The ’ U.S. Supreme Court has ruled > that all defendants who face possible jail terms are entitled to a lawyer. It was a seven to two decision J by Justice William Douglas. Justices Lewis Powell and ’ William Rehnquist, the dissenters, said the right should apply only when necessary to assure a fair trial. । ; The decision etxends to mis- ; ; demeanors and petty offenses a rigiit already proclaimed by । Ihe court in felony cases. < The decision means that mil- i lions of poor people who are prosecuted for relatively minor offenses will be guaranteed lawyers. The court also has agreed to rule on whether a criminal suspect is entitled to have a lawyer present when identification is made through a photograph. It decided some years ago that a man charged with .a crime has a right to a lawyer at a lineup. Last week, it said this right does not automatically apply to a man not yet charged with a crime who appears in a lineup.

The number of permits issued for any trail or area will be based on the capacity of that area to absorb visitor use without serious damage. If one trail area is being used to capacity, hikers will be directed to other, less used, trails. Information collected as the program is in progress will be used to help develop permanent programs for these and other parks which face potential environmental damage as backcountry use increases, park of ficials said."

Richard Poleet, 31, of Boston was dragged from his car Monday night and was kicked and beaten on the head with bricks by 10 to 20 black youths, officers said. He was on the danger list at a hospital early today, officials said. About the same time, a gang a mile away stoned trainmen trying to remove old tires and tree limbs piled on the tracks. No passengers or trainmen were injured, an Amtrak spokesman said. Police reported no arrests in either incident. Stonings of cars passing through the predominantly black Roxbury section were reported throughout the evening. Police said at least four windshields were smashed. A white man and woman were treated for head cuts after stones smashed their car windows not far from the intersection where Poleet was beaten. Police said both gangs apparently came from housing projects near the neighborhoods where the attacks occurred and retreated into the projects when patrol cars appeared. Saturday, white youths beat two black bus drivers and three white drivers who came to their rescue. And two weeks ago, white antibusing demonstrators beat a black attorney with a pole bearing the American flag and others kicked nim in an incident just outside Boston City Hall. Racial violence has flared sporadically in Boston since a federal district court two years ago ordered school children bused between black and white neighborhoods as part of a school integration plan. D.C. Hookers Convention WASHINGTON (AP) — A lot of shady ladies plan to join the onslaught of tourists visiting the nation’s capital this Bicentennial summer. They’ll be here for the third annual National Hookers Convention, a meeting complete with rallies, speeches and a flounce up to Capitol Hill. The hookers are coming to Washington to mount a national campaign to decriminalize prostitution and they figure the best place to start is where the laws are made, says Margo St. James, their leader.

Writes . y Japan as I Saw It j'i** For a change of subject let me tell you about the first anSvtte I attended in Japan. It was in Osaka at the Osaka a very popular theater where noted screen and stage stars make personal appearances. The performance WaZ titled “Haru no Odori” and the whole show consisted of two features of pictures and various dances by a bevy of c&orus girls who did their stuff very well in spite of the fast Hat none of .them had the shape that-we are prone to eitoect when we Year “chorus girl.” The stage setting was almostf too colorful 1 but very harmonious and the revolving Inform added much towards speeding up the show and giving u» a quick change in scenery for every dance. But why do they wear such revealing costumes when they know wen that their legs are none too shapely and far too short? I’m asking you. '• * * * Ff ’ AH aboard! Clang, clang! Choo choo! We were puffing opjpcff the Abeno station in Osaka for Ise, Japan’s most sic red shrine located in Miye ken, north of Wakayama. Aff thy seats were taken and there was no sign of any gentlemsh moving to make room for a lady, so stand I must ilMlf—? Faster and faster we traveled, skimming over the which whizzed dizzily through mountains, over rivers aid past fields of waving grain. I ft' was a gorgeous day in spring. The cherry blossoms in-fuff bloom and everyone (except me ,who had to island’ in the train) looked cheerful and buoyant. Ah! Cherry blossoms! Beautiful, fragile, fragrant, tender petals pink beneath azure skies. One must simply see the js&guisite blossoms for himself to really appreciate and understand the true meaning of the beauty in cherry blossoms. - a whole hour I patiently stood, rather leaned, against the side of the train and we were only half way. At the end of the next houi* we found ourselves fighting through the crowd of people towards the ticket entrance and into a taxi to take us to the bridge leading to the temple grounds. Ow! My poor poppies! By gran, it’s sure a terrific r&nritf to have to s$and for two hours on high-heeled clod hopperA That’s much better. (I-took ’em off in the taxi.) What a crowd!

They all go there to wash their hands and rinse their mouths in the act of purifying themselves before paying trifitate t b one of Nippon's greatest leaders. Weff, I P&ft exactly feel ahy too dean either so I washed my dirty and rinsed my mouth like the others. We tread further in through the gravel walk and stop in front of a huge wooden gate. Wfiat in the world! People were removing their coats before entering the sacred Even the Westernized ladies were stripping their jackets and coats.

Under the guise of nationalism and patriotism the patent cry of “yellow P en^Jf F I !?***^ y our Economic Royalists at their convenience. nationalism is not and never has been an ideology of ai natural sentiment of a people. It has never been anything else but a clever formula devisdd by the economic royalists to further extend and perpetuate their own power over the under-privileged masses. These economic royalists from time to time, chamaleon, undergo kaleidoscopic mutations to conceal the r identity. Yesterday, they were parading under the ban ner of the Liberty League; today, they are Jeffersonian I'enw crats, and tomorrow they may be Lincoln Republicans, these benighted gentlemen the American Constitution is less than a scrap of paper, the Bill of Rights, an obsolete joker in the archives of the nation. They attack the civil liberties and constitutional rights of the UT^ er ° American stock with the same feroeity and they attack the less fortunate Americans, who differ from them in the pigment of their skin. In the industrial area of our country these Royalists shift the blame for social unrest, caused by unemployment and starvation wages from their own shoulders on foreign agitators; ill the South it iff the Negro who is at the bottom of all evils and on the Pacific coast—the Japanese, Filipinos, and the Mexicans equally share the honor. To ease the miserable lot of the white paupers in the South, the Southern Aristocrats invented for them the most unique medium of entertainment lynching Negroes, burning dark people to cinders, crucifying them in order to divert the white paupers mrndS from their own wretchedness and turn their indignation against the black people who happen to be in a minority. The segregation of the Japanese people m California is a stigma on our civil life. It has a devastating effect on democratic traditions of the’American people who underj the influence of “Jim Crowism” are assuming a sense of superiority and treat the Japanese ( and other minorities as inferior people. I have no political ax to grind and no panaceas to offer. However, as an unbiased American citizen, I candidly believe that the Americans of Japanese extraction, regardless of their economic status, should once and for all cut their ties with the feudalists traditions, imported by the first generation from their native country, cut loose also from their own reactionary forces here. By supporting tne Republican Party and the Liberty Leaguers they are aiding and abetting their own enemies. The Japanese people in this country, like the other oppressed racial minorities, must boldly join hands with the progressive element erf our country in support of democracy and freedom. They must do so for their own self-preservation, for their own Says he : “She laughed in the bashfiff way of all Japanese : women, ducking her face behind a fldwery aleeve and peeking shyly above it, her almond eyes glistening witlf mischief” “My choice was a beauty, really*;. She w*a peaches and cream and don't let anyone tett you Japanese women are 'yellow'.

Loram. former commissioner of native affairs In South Africa. Dr. loram will teach In the University of Hawaii summer session which begins Monday, Dr. Loram, who arrived In Honolulu Thursday morning, has already toured the Kamehameha schools and conferred with several local authorities on Interracial relations. He was amoved by the high calibre of Instruction given in the Kamehameha schools and by their superior organisation. Hawaii's success In handling the various races that live here U due principally to three factors, said the former commissioner. He believes the local situation results from the tact that no race In Hawaii has ever been conquered or has ever lived in slavery, that there Is no \"cotor\" legislation In Hawaii, and that the local educational system Is well suited to Hawaii. He pointed out that all public schools are open to members of all races. South Africa has less racial harmony than any other place In the world, said Dr. Loram. The situation there Is due to repressive legislation In South Africa there la territorial, social and economic segregation of the races. Economic Segregation \"The 'blackfellows.' who outnumber the whites by more than three to one. have been given less and poorer land than the while people.\" said the professor. \"Only a few of the black children are allowed to attend schools and the schools to which they are sent are Inferior to those attended by white children. Certain occupations are barred to the black people. Far Instance, a law forbids all block people from operating machinery In Industry.\" \"These conditions have caused serious unrest In South Africa. Some of the 'blackfellows' look to the League of Nations tor assistance. Others look to communist Russia. Neither will give a solution to the problem. It must be solved by closer cooperation between the races.\" Dr. Loram believes that If the conditions In Hawaii were given wide publicity, the countries In which Interracial relations are less amicable would be stimulated to greater effort In the solution of their problems. Dr. Loram. who Is a professor of education In Yale unlveralty, Is to give two courses In the School of Pacific and Oriental Affairs of the summer session. In social anthropology, he will compare primitive and modern societies, explaining the advantages of each. The current International situation and the league of nations will be the subjects of his course on International relations Dr. Chang Will Give 1st Lecture Noted Chinese Educator to • Speak Tomorrow Evening Opening a scries of free Tuesday evening lectures at the University of Hawaii.

If the conference proceeds like this, the achievement ol the conference may be limited to declarations and no treatise or agreements, the Japanese delegates observe. In view of this dozing sltuaUou at the conference, the Japanese foreign office Is speeding up a program to cope with tho situation In case the conference results In failure. The causes of the standstill at the conference foUaw: 1. Differences between the United States and the European nations concerning the war debt situation. 3.

DELEGATES OF TWO NATIONS WELCOMED BY COUNT UCHIDA Conferees Hope to Settle North Manchuria Railway Problem Within Shortest Time Possible and Thereby Solve Half-Century-Old Issue fßengo RiJio lo Thr Nij.pu Jljll TOKYO. June 26. —Occupying the world spotlight am! promising a fovorablc turn In Par Eastern political situation, the Sovict-Mcnchu conference through the good offices of Japan for the purchase of the Soviet Interest in the North Manchuria railway company, formerly the Chinese Eastern railway, by Manchoukuo formally opened today at 2 p. m. at the official residence of Foreign Minister Count Yaattyi Uchlda. Foreign Minister Uchlda presided at this afternoon’s opening ceremonies. He welcomed the delegates to the conference. Representing Soviet Russia were Constantin Yurenev, Soviet ambassador to Japan; Benedict Kozlovsky, chief of the For Eastern division of the foreign com- i mlssariot; and Stephen Kuznetsov, I deputy director-general of the N.MR. Manchoukuo was represented by General Ting Bhlh-yuan. Manchoukuo minister to Japan, and Chulchl ohashl. vlcc-forelgn minister of Manchoukuo. Tile acsslan of the conference will be resumed tomorrow at the official residence of Vice-Foreign Minister Mamoru Bhlgemltsu at Karuimlgasekl. The delegates are attending the conference with the hope of settling the question within the shortest time passible and thereby at one stroke solve (he old Chinese Eastern railway Issue which lias been one of the constant sources of contusion and complication in Far Eastern peace and stabiltlr/ for the last half century. Soviet* Make Ollier It was on May 2 at Moscow that Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov first approached Tameklchl Ohta, Japan's ambassador to Soviet Russia, and made a formal verbal offer far the sale of the Soviet Interest In the Chinese Eastern railway, now the North Manchuria railway. Bluer i lien, negotiations have proceeded at ouch a fast pace that In leas than 80 days, formal negotiations tor the purchase of the Soviet Interest In the railway by Manchoukuo opened In Tokyo. The positions of the three countries In regard to the North Manchuria railway follow As the North Manchuria railway has been recently continuously showing deficits, and as the political and economic value of the railway hat been diminishing due the l winding at Manchoukuo, the Soviet government decided to give up (he railway and sell Iter interest in the railway to Manchoukuo. There were differences of opinion within the Soviet government circles as the abandonment of the railway by the Soviet union will mark a change In the vital national policy of the Soviet government But Stalin and Litvinov and their taction who have a clear grasp ol the future of the Fur Eastern situation were aware that the trend pointed toward the transfer of the Soviet Interest In the North Manchuria rollwuy. Manrhuukuo Bland The Manchoukuo government held the view that In spite of the outcome of the Soviet-Manchtiukuo negotiations, the North Manchuria railway will In the not too distant future be rendered useless a* It has established an Independent railway liollcy and built a railway network of Its own surrounding the North Manchurian railway. Then, 100. the Manchoukuo government contends thot the Soviet Interest In the North Manchuria railway docs not constitute the right of ownership and os the railway Is a joint enterprise, at the conference It will negotiate (or the purchase of the Soviet Interest in the joint enterprise. The Japanese government Is of the stand that as It will only offer Its good offices, It will limit the nature of the question of the purchase of the railway to a purely and wholly business proposition. Consequently should the Soviet delegation bring up various political Issues before the conference and thereby complicate the negotiations, the Japanese government Is prepared to firmly reject such political Issues. Political Problems TOKYO. June 26 (Rcngo Radio) —Although the main work of the Sovlel-Manchoukuo conference will be the negotiations on the purchase price provisions of the Soviet Interest In the N.M.R.. Indications are that various political Issues encompassing Japan, Manchoukuo and Soviet Russia will be mentioned at the conference as In reality the success or failure of the negotiations will hinge on the settlement of the political problems. The political topics that may be alluded at the conference Include; 1. The question of a Soviet-Jap-anese nan-aggression pact. 3. The problem of the abandasment of North Sakhalin. 1. The Issue of Soviet-Japanese fishing rights In the Maritime proprovinces. The Soviet-Mauohoukuo negotiations to Tokyo eon be considered as a revision oonlersnee at the Portsmouth convention concluded between Japan and Russia In 1606 at Portsmouth.

Southern ■ ■ Accent - - - - ' (Writer concludes his series of discussions on his Impressions of the Negroes of the South-) BY TOKUMI HAMAKO Negroes are indeed <a simple and happy people, given to sudden burst of laughter and fear, with untrained naive emotions.' It is an everyday occurrence to see poorly clad day-laborers talking and laughing merrily on street-cars, exposing their sal-mon-red gums ’ and polished monkey-teeth-like teeth, on their way to work in the morning and returning home after a day’s weary physical labor in the evening. It is equally common to see groups of young negro nurse maids sitting in the sun on church steps with their lovely curly»-haired and blue-eyed tiny masters and rocking with bombastic laughter. Of late I have come to believe that happiness is nothing blit, a chain of pleasant feelings obtained through five sense organ*. According to others who know better, however, happiness Is a state of mind. Whichever the case mhy be, whenever I see how these down-trodden black people work and live, I am convinced that it takes very little of material possession to be happy. And talk about having rhythm! Negroes certainly got it With them it is something quite natural and a priori and nothing superficial like love for classic music or literature and culture acquired through many hours of conscious effort* On gay Saturday and holiday evenings if, you should be along Royal Street, the narrow and poorly lighted main thoroughfaren of the Ok! French Quarter; lined with antique shops and restaurants, : or brightly lighted side' streets in the loop section, you will encounter very often schools of scantily clothed little black fellows and lasses trucking away to the amusement of passers-by. Bach group had a musician who harps on mouth-organ or bangs on prudely and ingeniously devised tin-can orchestra. For a penny the one-man band beats away and black lean feets fly to all directions. They got the rhythm, no fooling! — : —- Intention To Wed Petition Made For Consulate General : Central Japanese Association Here Sends ~ Request To Tokyo Government; Points To Volume Of Foreign Trade With Japan 1 蒙 '^ ■ pointed out that the volume of foreign trade with Japan was i. far in excess of that handled by ► the northern city, which already i has the consulate-general status, ■ and also to the fact that the i largest Japanese population in > America was found in the l Southern California area.

Post-graduate Assemblage University Club • Gives Unique Service By J. H. Hara, President Japanese University Club Millions have learned the value of regular exercise to keep ! in the pink of physical condi- . tion. It is axiomatic that disuse ‘ spells atrophy. Few realize that 1 this applies to the brain as well { as to the brawn. The brain that ' is not regularly exercised deteriorates. The mental processes slow down. Wits. become dull and one succumbs to morbidity, obscessions and defeatism. The person becomes an easy prey to worry, fear and an inferiority complex. MENTAL LETHARGY To those of us who have had the privilege of a college education there is the danger of mental lethargy from disuse*, We live in an age of progress. * The world is moving forward. Unless we keep step with the forward march we lag, and lag £ hopelessly. As a physician I c know not only the danger of in- > sufficient exercise but also that j of unbalanced exercise—of over- £ training along one line and lack t or absence of training in ano- £ ther. We need balanced mental r exercises. r There are many ways to keep a up, mentally, with this advan- r cing age. One means that ap- \\ peals to us is through the post- i graduate assemblage, such as s we expect to offer on the eve- r ning of March 19th at the Inter- < national Sunshine Club, 1101 S. 1 Westmoreland Ave. The speaker t of the evening will be Professor 1 Arthur' G.

RISE OF POPULAR NOVELIST This is the thumbnail sketch of Ashihei Hino, currently the leading popular novelist of Japan. Every military conflict in history has produced its writers, yet most such writers have gone long after hostilities ceased. Indeed, it was not until three or four years after the Great War that the really great books on that conflict started to appear. T. E. Lawrence’s ‘Seven Pillars of Wisdom’ was not completed until nearly ten years had elapsed. In this we claim that Ashihei Hino is unique in that he has written his books while serving on the front, and while he makes no claims to literary style, whatever that is, yet his works are no mere jottings or scraps such as one might expect under the conditions which he writes but books full' of interest, ftill of keen observations, descriptions of towns, of battles, of the Chinese people, of his own comrades and of their reactions to the grim business of war. PERFECT PICTURE His appeal to his countrymen lies in that he has succeeded in giving to the JapiUiese people a perfect picture of war from the soldier's viewpoint, -which the newspapers had never been able to give them. It is his simple sincerity which is perhaps the reason for his wide appeal. He is the true Japanese nature lover and finds himself in .deep sympathy with Chinese farmers who have had to desert their crops in face of the approaching troops. In these termer folk he sees their prototypes of his own land. . WAR BOOK V In ‘Barley and Soldier,’ his first war book which has put him in the literary limelight, his observations when as a member of the Army Press Bureau he accompanies the armies in their attack on Hsuchow in May 1939 he attends a ceremony, a farmer's meeting of which he says: “My heart went out to them, for they ’seemed so simple and sq near to the good clean earth. I know their prototypes among • the farmers of my native country. How could one expect such folk to understand the workings of politics add the moving* of government decrees., Their life is of the soil and the soil their life.

(Dome!) —Hitherto undisclosed* facts and aims of the Wang Ching Wei regime were disclosed today by one of his chief aides, Choh Feng Hai, which explore the 1 ultimate relations among this | regime and the Chungking government and Japan. As Choh and Wang envision this setup, which doubtless receives cognizance of Japanese authorities, their new government is an instrument to facilitate China’s transition from wartime to peacetime and reconstruction era. It envisions the gradual recovery of administrative authorities from the Japanese armies of occupation. Moreover, Wang is not losing sight of the fact that there may come a time when Chiang Kai Shek and the Japanese generals will call off the battles. Whenever this should occur, the Wang government is ready to cooperate.

Turkey and _ her allies will never permit this. J No wonder Soviet Russia; immediately after the beginning of the war between Germany and England, started to carry out \\ her plan which was to secure use of the seaports In the Scandinavian peninsula. This resulted 'In the treaty between Russia and Latvia, etc. Following these Jj negotiations, she approached Finland, demanding this and that port. When Finland refused, it was war. ‘ In my opinion, Soviet Russia wants outlets through which | international trade may be conducted but not territories. | Therefore, as long as some amicable settlement could be made granting Soviet Russia, the right to use sea ports along the coast of Norway and Denmark, it is unlikely that there will.be any conflict between Soviet Rus- ‘ sia and these two countries. Soviet Russia is already in possession of vast territories extending from Asia to Europe. As far as areas are concerned, she is the biggest nation in the world and she needs no more territories. What she needs is outlets. Soviet Russia lacks seaport for exchange of goods with other countries. In Asia she has long sought to establish her foothold along the Chinese coast. • • After the Sino-Japanese war she succeeded in obtaining a large piece of land in China which later became part of the present Manchurian territories. Sh£ has built the eastern Chinese railway between Vladivostok and Manchuri through the heart of Manchuria. Along the Black Sea region she seems to have no chance of gaining an outlet to the outside world because the only way she can accomplish this is through the * | Vantage Points 1 — — ‘ \" ISSUE AT STAKE < % in effect, the sentiment of not a few government offteW© and an appreciable proportion of the public seems to ; while it is all right for the Chinese nisei to bear propaganda banners and stage anti-Japanese demonstrations and afl&iCSIl ?* champion solicitation of funds for the natives in China, but that the Japanese nisei, because they are American citizens, ought _ not to take issue in the legislative matters affecting their J parents.

One thing the people of Hawaii would like to know is just how the senator feels about the American born Mexicans and Negroes of Texas. Does he feel that they too are \"foreigners” as he labelled the people of Hawaii? And does Senator Connally feel that the native born Indians of Texas are poor citizens? Both Sector Connally and many of his fellow residents of Texas have a shameful record in regard to minority groups. Mexicans, Negroes, Indians and other minorities have been treated much as Hitler treated the Jews shortly after he came into power. Perhaps Senator Connally hopes later to carry on with the more rigorous measures used by Hitler after he had consolidated his hold on the German people. America's stand before the nations of the world . . . both East and West . . . was weakened yesterday when Connally admitted his prejudices, and made them official by shouting them from the senate floor. America’s diplomats will have a hard time telling the brown people and the yellow people and the black people of the world that wc are on the side of freedofn and self expression when Senator Connally’s remarks are emblazoned across the pages of the Congressional Directory. Any Communist, either in the U. S. or outside, who wants ammunition against our foreign and domestic policiei can find that ammunition in the shameful words of Connally. Unfortunately his attitude is not entirely isolated. He was merely echoing the words and thoughts of a large segment of the Caucasian people of the Southern United States. Connally merely made it officiaj. What should be done by the supporters of statehood in view of the bloc represented by Connally? Certainly we should not give up the fight as useless. Although this newspaper has stated editorially that this very tiling was almost inevitable, we do not believe that Senator Connally’s attitude and statements should be taken peacefully. We should fight, with every legal weapon at hand, to show up Connally, and his bigoted cohorts, for the un-American and short-sighted individuals we bdlieve them to be. Hawaii does not belong tn the United States by right of conquest. Nor were these Islands obtained by the U. S. m a trade or by outright purchase. We joined the United States under a fair and honest agreement. Part of that agreement, clearly understood by both sides, was that Hawaii was to become a state when it was ready. We challenge Senator Connally to put the record of Texas against that of Hawaii from the standpoint of citizenship, patriotism, or any other standard of readiness for statehood. We are as capable, and as deserving of statehood as Texas is today. Certainly we have proven more loyalty to the U. S. than have the people of Texas, where the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution is flouted daily!

ROBERT CHINA EDWARD CHINA , (Hawaii Times, Mar 4, 5, 1952) Oman, Michiyakko T rbupes In Friendly Chat Backstage By JAMES T. HAMADA , , The Onton and Michiyakko troupea met for a friendly chat backstage at InternaUpnal Theater Sunday afternoon after the matinee. It was one of the most Interesting meetings we’ve witnessed. When two groups of entertainers get together you cep expect a lot of revealing and amusing talki. Oman and Michiyakko talked plenty of their em- barrassing moments during their tours but the conversations were mostly of private nature and we can’t print them. Gomanraku Vyeda, the \"otosan” of the MlchiyaHto troupe, was in the audience dp front during the stage show Sunday. Oman spotted, him and called attention to his presence as she pointed in his infection with her chin. When the show ended Gomanraku headed toward . backstage, so we followed him. When we arrived there we found Michiyakko, Chle Nagata and Kyoko Nagata there, too. chatting with the Oman quar-' tette. Selling of ’’BromldeeMlchiyakko, a ready conversationalist and fast talker, talked more than Oman and one of their topics’ was the selling of ’’bromides’’ (autographed photos) during Intermissions at shows. Some of the Onun Ohtsu Michiyakko embarrassing moments they met during the sales were very amusing. If we could only tell you! , 1 Oman asked Michiyakko if she was going to have an orchestra when her troupe tours the other islands. “No,” replied Michiyakko. “We’ve made a tape recording of Shochiku orchestra’s accompaniment. It’s per- ' fectly ddne. All I have to do is 1 sing with it. ' “Tape recording machines are very handy for show people. It costs about $180 here. That would be about 80,000 yen. That’s an awful lot of money in Japan. But $150 here isn’t much. I’d like to buy one when I go home.” The subject then shifted to the accordion used by Hldeko Nakajlma - of the Oman troype. 1 “I didn't bring It with me,” Miss ' Nakajlma said. “It was bought for ; me (by the promoters) after I arrived here. It’s a used accordion. ' They paid $96.” If the Tokyo Meijlnkal troupe had also been present, what a get- ’ together it would have been! This i troupe U now on tour on the other > Islands. Mori Sisters Know Oman The Mori sisters. Nobuko and Hldeko, of thia troupe are close friends of Oman. At a chop suey dinner 1 recently while they were still here, they told u« tAat they had known Oman for years and that occasionally they even helped with her shows.

A tBS /’W Looters In Detroit Raid Drug Store Yesterday (UPI CABLEPHOTO) Canadian Cabinet Scorns De Gaulle By United Press International The most widespread racial violence in the nation's history spread through a dozen cities today, threatened others and turned parts of Detroit into a rioman’s land where Federal troops battled snipers with tanks and machine guns. Springing from the widespread violence was a battle of anothei kind—the battle of who to blann ’ for the nation’s general racial climate. Republicans were quick to hang the responsibility on President ; Johnson, who they claim “hiss to- ; tally failed to recognize the problem.\" GOP leaders in both houset called for a full scale investigation of the riots. House Democratic leader Car) Albert countered by accusing the Republicans of \"playing politics' with tragedy. House Speaker John W. McCormack was among the first tc come to the Presidents defense. He declared: “Thase who today speak piously of anarchy in the streets have not resltated to strike down some of the mast progressive laws aimed at these problems.\" President Johnson made his position clear in a statement last night shortly after ordering troops into Detroit. “We will not tolerate lawlessness,” he said. “We will not endure violence. It matters not by whom it is done or under what slogan or banner. It will not b<, tolerated. This nation will do whatever is necessary to suppress and punish those who engage in It.” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the nation’ top integration leader, said today he supports Johnson's decision, but contended \"the suicidal and irrational acts which plague our streets daily are being sowed and watered by the irratlnoal. irrelevant and equally suicidal debate and delay in Congress.\" He referred to Congress' failure to | act favorably on housing and employment legislation. Lester Maddox, one of the mo t outspoken segregationists in tiic nation until his election as Georgia Governor, said the Pre Ident's plea for law and order was \"too little, too late.” Maddox said the riots were a \"Communist drive to overthro.v this nation and anybody in Washington who says differently is either a liar or a fool.” The Georgia Governor also had harsh words for his Michigan counterpart. \"Governor Romney himself has paraded with the bums (Negro demonstrators) and now he has to watch them loot and burn,\" Maddox said. There were these developments: PONTIAC — Two Negroes were killed in racial violence one of them by a State Legislator who was protecting his store from looting. About 40 fires were set and at least 25 Negroes were ar* rested. ROCHESTEb — Fire-bombing, lootings and sniping erupted last night, on the third anniversary of a previous racial flareup. FLINT — Roving bands of Negro youths stoned automobiles and stores, and burglarized several businesses. NEW YORK — Police shot it out with Puerto Rican youths firing rifles and hurling rocks from the top of tenement houses. Two persons were killed in the violence, the third outburst in as many nights. CAMBRIDGE — Negro arsonists set fire to buildings on two city blocks and exchanged gunfire with police and National Guardsmen. A church and a school were among the buildings set ablaze. LIMA — Twenty-one youths were taken into custody after breaking several store windows, but police said no looting was involved. GRAND RAPIDS — Roving bands of Negroes smashed store windows, set fires and threw rocks at police cars before officers managed to stem the disturbance. HOUSTON — groups of Negroes roamed the streets throwing rocks at stores and pac ing cars, but there were no injuries or arrests. ENGLEWOOD Negro snipers pinned down 100 policemen for more than an hour before a heavy rain finally put an end to the disturbance. TUCSON — More than 100 Negro youths encaged police in a second night of violence, hurling rocks and bottles and tassing a firebomb onto the roof of a paint •store. The firebomb caused only minor t ainage. TOLEDO — More than 80 persons were arrested when a band of young Negroes went on a rampage, looting stores and toss- JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (UPH — Fifty Africans died today u/ : er the jobnailed boots of thousands of men rushing to work through a subway passage leading to the world's richest goldmine. Another 49 were seriously injured. According to company reports, one man apparently stumbled on steps leading down into the mine. He pitched forward, causing several men in front to lose their balahce. The men behind, as many as 10,000 of them, surged forward, not realizing that anything was wrong. The panic-stricken men screamed, trying to free themselves from the crushing weight of men behind piling up on top of them. Several of the dead suffocated, reports said. The mine, owned by the An-glo-American corporation in one of the world's richest, and one of the most modern. The subway in which the men were trapped and crushed runs from hostels in which the men Ijve with their families to the number three shaft in the mine. It was constructed to allow the workers to go from their homes to their jobs without being exposed to the weather. I The Department of Mines in Pretoria announced that a preliminary investigation was launched immediately, and it would be followed by a full inquiry. The mine is located 50 miles from Johannesburg. It is called the western deep levels gold mine. The worst previous disaster at the mine was in 1909 when a sudden rush of water in the lower workings drowned 152 men. The worst mine disaster in South Africa occurr ed In January 1960 when the roof of the coalbrook coal mine collapsed killing 437 miners. By midday, today tire death toll had surged to 30 since the weekend, with the end still not in sight. Mast of the violence was concentrated in the heart of the nation’s highly industrialized northeast. section. Property damage was counted in the millions—$200-milllon in Detroit alone—as the result of looting and intentionally-set fires that swallowed up entire city blocks. < “Just put a few rice paddies down there and it’ll be the same” as Vietnam a Negro Marine said with tears in his eyes when he returned to his Detroit home today from the war. Next to Detroit, Cambridge, Md., was probably the hardest hit. Negroes there burned two blocks of their ghtkto and exchanged gunfire with police and 200 National Guardsmen before peace was restored. There was also violence in New York City, Rochester, N.Y., Pontiac, Flint and Grand Rapids, Mich., Toledo and Lima, Ohio, Englewood. N.J., Tucson, Arlz. and Houston, Tex. Grand Rapids, Mich., experienced a mild outbreak and banned the sale of beer and liquor in an effort to headoff serious trouble. Cairo. Ill., also was tense. Pontiac, Rochester and New York reported two deaths each in their rioting. By afternoon the Federal troops ordered into Detroit by President Johnson, had control of the riottorn c |y, but Gov. George Romney kept emergency measures in effect. The motor center of the world has counted 24 dead, at least three of them white, and more than 1,500 injured since the racial insurrection 1 began Sunday morning with a routine police raid on a Negro after-hours tavern. C&H Strike Settled CROCKETT, Cal. 1UPI1 — Members of the sugar workers union voted acceptance of a new contract by a 3-1 margin last night to end a 43-day strike at the big Crockett refinery of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Co. The vote in favor of the new pact hammered out by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service was 633 to 200, The 1,200 union workers at the refinery had rejected a tentative company offer June 27. Workers will receive a pay boost of 35 cents an hour over the next three years yith 15 cents retroactive to Feb. 1, Pay hikes for each of the next two years will be 10 cents per hour. A company spokesman said he expects the refinery to resume full operations within 48 hours. Also included in the new pact was a six-year agreement providing for the company to pay an increasing share of health and welfare benefit premiums. Workers will contribute about $9 per month until June 1, 1969 when the employee contribution will drop to $2 a month. The company will pay the balance. An improvement also was made in the severance clause. Persons working a minimum of three years with the company will be paid $200 per year severance pay instead of the current $130 if they are laid off because of equipment or method changes. MONTREAL OD—French President Charles De Gaulle toured the Expo '67 pavilions today as the Canadian cabinet prepared to meet with Prime Minister Lester Pearson to consider the speech De Gaulle made last night endorsing the “Free Quebec” slogan of French-Canadian Separatisas. De Gaulle, dressed today in a dark suit instead of the Army uniform he has worn during the first days of his state visit to Canada, appeared oblivious of the uproar he had created with his exhortations to French Nationalists. The 76-year-old general did, for the first time since his arrival, conclude his speech with the words “Long Live Canada\" when he addressed a crowd of some 10.000 at the Place of the Nations : at Expo '67. There was some booing of the French President from I the audience. Pearson was scheduled to meet ■ with his cabinet in Ottawa short1 ly after noon. s The Canadian Prime Minister 5 last night asked the French Emr bassy for an exact translation of i De Gaulle's speech from a balcony ■ of the Montreal City Hall. He t told a widely cheering crowd that not since the liberation of France i in World War II hud he seen ' such scenes as his reception by s hte 80 per cent French-speaking populace if Quebec. Then he shouted the \"Free Quebec\" slogan of the Separatists. This morning De Gaulle went first to a breakfast at the Ritz Carlton Hotel where he met some 300 guests representing the elite of the French colony in Montreal. Some younger French girls wore miniskirts. Punch and chain- : pagne were served to the guests. From there De Gaulle went on I to Expo '67 which was celebrating I “France Day.\" At the Place of the Nations. De Gaulle spoke • of the exhibits he intended to visit during the day, ■ including tho«c of . the Soviet ■ Union and the United States, and I said: ■ “Even though they may seem to stand in separate camps, they are ■ all friends of France.”De Gaulle was scheduled to go to Ottawa tomorrow afternoon and to meet with Pearson Thursday morning before flying back to Paris. The Royal Canadian mounted Police in the national capital acknowledged today they had received a number of texphone calls threatening the French President. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation <CBC> said last night there was speculation in Ottawa that the Canadian government might ask De Gaulle to terminate his visit. Before the Federal troops moved t in, bands of Negroes opened fire } on four precinct police stations—-using a machine gun in one case. H. Rap Brown chairman of the Student Non-Vio‘lent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was blamed k for the violence in Cambridge, t and a warrant charging him with v inciting a riot was Issued for his li arrest. a Brown told Negroes at a rally r last night: \"Get a gun. I don’t care if it’s li a BB gun with poisoned BBs. r \"America has to come around o or black people are going to burn it down.” g Brown was one of two persons s wounded In the Cambridge vlo- b lence. He was treated at a local hospital for a shotgun pellet o wound on the forehead, and then ii dropped from sight. tl “I hope they pick him up soon, p put him away and throw away 1< the key,” said Maryland Gov. n Spiro T. Agnew after a tour of the riot-wracked area. ij — — — c UH Confab Taking Up Collective Bargaining The Labor-Management Education Program College of General Studies, University of Hawaii will sponsor a conference-“Challenges to Collective Bargaining,” featuring four mainland speakers, at the Pacific Ballroom, Illkal Hotel on Aug. 11 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The conference will discuss such questions as: “Can Collective Bargaining between labor and management meet and solve the problems now arising between employers and employees? Can it solve the problems created by automation? Can it adequately protect the public interest? What can It do to prevent strikes that effect public interest, both in private industry and public employment? Is collective bargaining as an institution really on the way out? Do we need new laws? Is compulsory arbitration the answer?\" These and related questions trouble people who think about management-labor relations today. This conference is extremely timely and should be highly provocative.

Russians Woo Arab Countries By PHIL NEWSOM UPI Foreign New« Analyst Victor and vanquished in the Middle East are learning the high cost of war. If United Arab Republic President Gamal Nasser had won, he would have had the Middle East at his feet. As it Is, he probably owes the fact that he contihues in office to new, massive aid from the Russians who In turn face increased grumbling among other members of the Communist Bloc against their share of the cost. As for the Israelis, they also face mounting problems but In the main theirs are happier ones consisting of jammed hotels, a tremendous influx of visitors whose buses clog the highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and others attendant upon union of the old Jordanian and-Israeli parts of the city. The cost to the Soviet Union also has been high. Losses in So-viet-supplied equipment, either as battle casualties or to Arab misuse, have been estimated as high as $2 billion in the U.A.R. alone. Cairo reports say that by acting quickly to replace an undisclosed percentage of U.A.R. losses, the Soviet Union regained much of the Arab goodwill It lost-when it refused to intervene militarily in the conflict. Up until a year ago when the U.8. program of food aid to the U.A.R. expired, it was setimated that half the caloric Intake of Egypt’s city poppulatlon came as American supplies of wheat, chickens and other farm products. s Faced with a mounting stream i of abuse from Nasser, the United States did not renew* the agreement and Nasser was forced to ■ dip into fast-dwindling supplies ! of foreign exchange to buy food ; elsewhere. Current estimates place his de- . licit this year at around $500 mll- ■ lion with no way to cover it. Foreign reserves are said to be . down to around $100 million. ■ So long as the Suez Canal re- । mains closed, Nasser is losing $575,000 a day. Huge losses also , will be incurred In tourism which in better times brought in $70 million annually. Since Nasser has more than exhausted his western credits, that seems to place it squarely up to he Soviets and their allies. Their grain crops were better than usual this year but probably not all that good and certainly not so good that vast food shipments can be sent to the U.A.R. wlhout serious grumbling at home. Among east European nations, this grumbling already has begun. The nations which blindly followed Soviet policy in the United Nations now are having second thoughts, and are said to have told the Russians so at the recent Communist summit meeting in Budapest. For the moment the Russians are playing along with Nasser, but neither they nor Nasser have yet received the full bill. niiiiiinHniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Drusilla Named For Award Nineteen-year-old Drusilla Akamine, who recently was awarded a young American Medal from President Johnson for her work with mentally retarded children, has been nominated for another' national award.

Gradual Pullout Of Allied Troops By Early 1969-Vy SAIGON (AP) — Defense Min- I ister Nguyen Van Vy said today I general mobilization of South Vietnam’s manpower would al- I low the allies to begin a gradual troop withdrawal by the start of । 1969. Vy said such a general mobili- : ration would have to be m u c h more far reaching than the one । now proposed. Earlier this month, President Nguyen. Van Thieu said that if the United States requests a i withdrawal of its troops, “we ean agree to a gradual withdrawal beginning by the end of 1968. , Since that time, Thieu has asked the legislature for the power to call general mobilization. The government has launched a program to s e t up local selfdefense units around the country. Thieu also has announced an Increase of 135,000 in armed forces strength, apart from any mobilization move.

The FBI said a systematic search of its vast fingerprint files identified the 40-year-old Ray as phantom fugitive Erie Starvo Galt, charged in Tennessee with murdering King April 4. The FBI action today added formality to what was already a fact — the escapee from the Missouri state penitentiary is the nation’s most intensely hunted man in years. Ray was described as an avid dancer, a high school dropout, Army reject, a man who likes to drink beer and vodka, and who tugs his ear when he’s nervous.

Unequal education, jobs, housing, and various opportunities that other Americans now enjoy, we are still deprived of those same opportunities. No matter how much the Whites, and other races in Hawaii might not have liked you, you were allowed to attend “their public schools” and other public institutions of learning and worship. ■ Therefore the Americans of Japanese Ancestry’s main barriers were language and, before and during World War II, the questioning of their loyalty to the United States of America. One last comment I would like to bring to your attention. If it was not for the Black American, I think there would still be more race prejudice. I deeply believe that the White man would still have the same attitudes and possibly even stronger resentment towards the Americans of Japanese Ancestry and other Americans of Oriental Ancestry. If you do not believe this, take a trip to the mainland and start out from the South and spend as much as four months in a segment of that area and then continue to your border line states and in about two years, I think you will truly understand how things are in America. Maybe you already know and that is why you are here in Hawaii. I do not believe that any other race of people but the Blacks would have put up with a situation over a period of 200 years without a rebellion a long time ago. I lived in the Orient for over six years and do know the people well enough to know that they will stand for something to go on for so long and if peaceful demonstrations and non-violence can not solve the problems, they will become more militant and even violent. Vietnam is a good example for the last thirty years. If we as so called “responsible Americans” would do our home work first; assure that every man would be treated in this country as a true American, not according to race, creed, color or religion then I think that our missions abroad could be accomplished a lot easier. Until then, it will not be an easy task at all.

The lone robber tied up the bartender at John Henry’s Bar, on the 20th floor of the Ala Moana Building, shortly after the bar closed. The bartender, 25-year-old Robert Meltzer, told police that the man walked into the plush bar about 9:15 p.m. He said he was forced at gunpoint to open the cash drawer, and to kneel on the floor while he was gagged and his hands and feet bound. , LEGAL NOTICE ~~ NOTICE FAMILY COURT, FIRST CIRCUIT STATE OF HAWAII D.

(Hawaii Times: April 20, 27; May 4, 1968) Dear Mr. Hirai: J redd your editorial entitled : “Mourning the Death of Rev. 1 Martin Luther King; Negroes ’ Urged To Act With Prudence.” : This was in The Hawaii Times, dated April 13, 1968. I agree with the first five para- I graphs of your editorial as a i Black Man. As a person of Japa- i nese ancestry, from your editorial 1 gathered you knew very ’ little about 25 million or more : Black Americans. We were the ’ only people of this “Land of the । free and home of the brave” that j Were put into slavery for over i 200 years and even in slavery, - Black Men and Women contrib- . uted a lot to this country. Black । slaves gave America free labor ; for over 200 years. । The Black American slaves i contributed more for this country than you will ever realize. The Black slaves built America and maybe some day you will find this out.The White slave owners and traders contributed the greatest injustice to America and now their descendants are feeling some of the sting of a small segment of Black people responding in anger to an overripen condition. I think there is no comparison at all of the “American-Negro” with the American of Japanese ancestry, unless you can prove that both races were truly slaves J in every aspect in this country and for the same length of time. I would also like to let you know that a “Negro” has been in every war that there has been . fought for America and her Allies, starting with the war against the Indians, the “Civil War”, World War I, World War II, KoI rea, and now Vietnam. At present the “Negro” repre- • sents over 25% of the total U.S. . troops in Vietnam. How much of a percentage do the Ameri- [ cans of Japanese Ancestry represent? I realize that you, as a. member of a minority race, also have had problems. I know for a fact that the Americans of Oriental ancestry were mistreated but n o t even close to what we as Black people experience even today, in the various states and even ih some foreign countries which White Americans, mostly service people, have spread lies about us as a race. One can not “Elevate his cultural status through his own efforts”, especially while completely isolated from past culture and forbidden in all aspects, even the education of reading and writing of the English Language, alsd. worship of God had to be done in secret.

PRICE 12 CENTS voice of bpjl the times jFW By RYUZO HIRAI Draft Cards Burning Students And Teachers Who Incite Them ! ; : families of employees earning less than $100 a month and subject to callup from National Guard and Army Reserve units. This is a warm-hearted gesture indeed, worthy of respect as a commendable undertaking. Also, on the island of Hawaii, where a large number of Americans of Japanese ancestry have been called to the Colors, an aged grandmother is said to have encouraged her grandson who is subject to military service in these patriotic words: “It’s for your country. Go forth like a man and do your stint.” In contrast to this, 12 Univer-, sity of Hawaii students with warped minds who were apparently incensed by the callup of the National Guard and Army Reserve units, are said to have burned their draft cards. Furthermore, it is downright shameless that teachers leading the anti-war movement at the University of Hawaii who reportedly incited these draft dodgers to bum their draft cards in public places, are said to have praised them highly at the memorial service for the late Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. No matter how democratic this country may be, would it be proper to let these university students who take great pride in acting traitorously, as well as the dangerous teachers inciting them, to behave with such unrestricted freedom? i Just when the mood for peace ■ seemed to manifest itself out of the long-drawn-out war in Viet- , nam, the Defense Department issued a callup of Hawaii’s National Guard and Army Reserve units, totaling 4,100 by May 13. This came like a bolt from th' blue to the people of Hawaii. Soon after the announcement, Hawaii's Representative Spark Matsunaga is said to have reported to President Johnson: “The people of Hawaii will gladly serve their country, but it seems to me that the callup quota, being 17 percent of the total called up nationally, is too many, and I should like to ask for a reappraisal.” Certainly, in a state like Hawaii where the population is relatively small and the labor force is at best minimal, a sudden callup of 4,000 of its human resources to serve on the front , line is bound to cause great hard- , ship at all places of work on the ( home front. Everyone must be mindful of , the fact, of course, that no matter how pressing one's personal , circumstances may be, the fore- , most priority must be to perform , one’s duty to serve his country I in time of need, whether in peace । or war. , The Hawaii Government Em- , ployees Association is said to , have started a movement not . only to suspend monthly install- , ment payments, but also to help TOKYO TOP ra/ENTy WM ft KEN FRANKEL t1.

Step in Wrong Direction Seventeen jnembers of the Negro race have held in Honolulu the first State convention of the new and disturbing rjacial political party called the Afro-American Unity Party. Purpose of the convention was to take action to get the party’s candidates and electors on the November ballot in Hawaii. : The formation of this political organization that says it \"calls out to the mulatto, tan, brown and the black people of America\" to join in finding a solution to racial problems is a step in exactly the wrong direction towards solving any <jf America’s problems including racial. In our democracy, any group of people have the legal right to form a political party. But no individual or group has the moral right to form any type of organization whose actions can only foment racial problems and that is all that the new Afro-American Unity Party can possibly do. It is unfortunately true enough American citizens of the Negro race have long been deprived of their full civil rights in some areas, of the Mainland. This is, of course, an intolerable situation, and the right thinking people of America a|re determinedly making progress towards correcting it. ] However, for a small minority of mis-guided AfroAmericans to band together to form a political party along strictly racial lines in the belief that they can speed up a solution to the Negro civil rights problems is dead wrong jiist as it would be dead wrong for any other Amfrican citizens of any other racial extraction to organize and pit tjhemselves against citizens of all other racial descents. | The new Afro-American Unity Party can only make more acute present Negro problems and create new ones. It is-a step in the wrong direction.

Youngsters Defy Stares and Whispers; To Date Across Racial Lines By CONNIE ROSENBAUM St. Louis Post Dispatch Writer (AP) — Skip and Sara spend most of their time al home. He comes to her house after his art class at the junior college and they visit on her porch, or watch television or take in a movie. They used to go to more public places but now they slay mostly to themselves. In many respects they are like any other young couple except that Skip is black and has a thick kinky Afro beneath his bush hat: and Sara is white, with long brown hair hanging straight over her shoulders. They are one of an increasing number of interracial couples, “People stare and whisper when we go places so we just decided to try to avoid it.\" he said. \"Sometimes we stare back until they become self-conscious, then we smile and flash a peace sign.\" Skip and Sara met last year while they were students at Kirkwood High School. Other couples have met at work, on Sunday afternoon park outings, al peace marches, sporting events or friends' parties. The motivations for dating are mixed on both sides. Many white girls say they are intrigued by the virility myth \"about black men. \"Sure they come on strong.\" said Janet, a senior art student \"nt Washington University. \"These guys are different and that is part of their appeal. They have ojher experiences to share and usually the blacks who date white girls are the real achievers.\" Black girls have noticed this point too and deeply resent it. ’ ^These white chicks arc encroaching on our territory,\" said a fiery young education major gt Meramec Community College. “The whites only want to date, the outstanding guys anyway, the ( school leaders and athletic stars, and that makes it hard for us to find dates.” Black girls are equally skeptical about white men who ask them out. Many refuse, saying they feel like objects of curiosity. “I used to dale a white man.\" said a 24-year-old fashion artist. “It got awkward though. I had the feeling that he wasn't interested in me as much as he liked the fact that I was black.\" Interracial dating is strong!) opposed by most black nationalists. The movement emphasizes the beauty of the black race and encourages the followers the support the new cultural emergence. \"The American standard of beauty still favors the white chick.\" said a Washington University senior who had recently bobbed her hair into a frizzy natural. \"Men fall for girls with long sleek hair and light skin. But it is fast changing. If people believe in their race, they should prove it by dating black.\" Many of the most ardent male activists, however, persist with the mixed racial pattern. One common reason they give for prefering white dates is the difference in education. “Many of the black girls don't have as much college as we do and it is hard to find things to talk about.\" said a 22-year-old leader of a black campus club. \"Maybe it is a challerfge. a status thing, but a lot of these white girls are more for the movement than their black counterparts.\" A large percentage of white girls who date blacks arc actively involved in campus political movements on the left. They struck for _ grapes, picketed for peace, tutored in the ghetto and a few even migrated south for the summer to work with civil rights groups. •* “Dattng blarfcr might be~a-snlT-i conscious attempt to prove how liberal 1 really am.\" said a woman graduate in political science from California. “ But the fact fg that Ifs a 10glcal nr/e.

Gold medal winner of the springboard dive event in the Mexico City Olympic Games, Miss Gossick, now 22, had been singled out at the age of 9 by the Olympic Development Commission as a future champion. “I believe strongly that physical activity results in good toning of leg, stomach and other muscles.\" remarks the woman who, when 20, was honored by the Los Angeles Times through its annual achievement award. Winner of 21 gold medals, she is a veteran of the Tokyo Olympics of 1964 and has been a finalist in 22 out of 24 national springboard championships. In pursuit of her belief in par- -. ticipation in physical activities, the champion recently endorsed a new game in which players jump over a spinning rod as best they can. Intended for players from age 7 to adult, \"Limbo Legs” by Milton Bradley fea-: tures a spinner and \"limbo” rod which can be set high or low and at fast or slow speeds. If participants miss or touch the rod they’re eliminated. Last one in the “limbo” circle wins. Sue feels that Americans — either in their homes or out of doors - should jump at the chance to take part in this invigorating exercise. FEWER COFFEE BREAKS FRANKFORT, Ky.

Actress Hopes to Make Blacks More Beautiful Mi'-h'lnno i'ri':iiH< -mH t rv t* By ARLEEN ABRAHAMS Associated Press Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Black is beautiful. And if actress Denise Nicholas has her way, blacks will be even more beautiful. Twenty-five-year-old Denise, better known to television audiences as Liz McIntyre in ABC-TV,’s Room 222, can I contain her enthusiasm over her latest project, a book on black, beauty. “I used to read political books,” f V/rss DENISE NICHOLAS .. The outspoken actress, featured in the television series \"Room 222\" has very definite ideas about black beauty. use bleaching creams and try to emulate the pretty white girls look ridiculous.\" she says scornfully. \"Black girls must learn there's no one black standard of beauty.\" she comments. \"How can there be with so much mixing? Just look al my family. We range from the traditional-Afro black to myself with straight hair and hazel eyes.” Too many black women are insecure about their looks, she claims. \"One thing white women have is a sense of security in terms of physical appearance. I wish we blackicould take from the whites this sense of security, which is reflected in the way whites look and feel about themselves. We must define and hold out for what we are.\" In addition to writing the book on black beauty. Denise is trying to get into film or stage work. Also, she currently cut a record, although she has no idea of its marketing potential. But she feels it's never too late to start a new venture. “It wasn't until I was a student at the University of Michigan that I first got enthused about acting and that was in a Spanish-language play,\" she recalls. Her introduction to the theatrical world began in earnest in the summer of '64 when she became involved in the administrative and I directing end of the Free Southern । Theatre, a touring company. The following year, while studying art I at Tulane University and teaching I political action and Afro-Ameri- ' can history to black youngsters l she came to the attention of Vii veca Lindfors who enlisted her l talents for a dramatic program, r \"Three Boards and a Passion” - that toured northern college towns. Miss Nicholas finally s broke into New York theatre in i the off-Broadway production. c \"Viet Rock.\" several years ago. e At present she lives in an apartk ment in Los Angeles that she plans > to furnish with antiques. said the Detroit-born divorcee, referring to her days as a political science major at the University of Michigan — the place where the acting bug first bit her. “Now I read diet books, beauty books, exercise books. This black beauty book is so important to me.” The 5 foot 7, 120-pound hazeleyed beauty, whose grandfather's mother was a full-blooded Indian, explains that her involvement with black beauty came about accidentally. “I was participating in a seminar at a black ghetto high school and I hadn’t prepared a speech. What I said just came out,” she recalls. What came out went something like this: “I look around and think it’s very funny to sec young girls whose primary interest is boys with problems of bad posture and bad feet, the latter a result of , wearing improper shoes. I know I that these are two particular probf lems of black women. But they : can be corrected. I “Sure, after years and years of , doing domestic work, laboring t long hours, not resting properly and not being able to afford beds - and chairs that arc good for the s back, it’s no wonder black women , have poor posture.” ’ Secondly, Denise noted that black women tend to swagger 1 when they walk. “Of course, 1 they’re hippier than white worn1 en,” she comments, “but our walk c is symbolic of a defiance of white beauty standards. “Don’t get me wrong, I s wouldn’t want to do away with the s special walk,” she said. “What j I’m trying to tell the girls is that f there's a way of walking that isn’t harmful to the body. I notice a lot of black chicks walking on the sides of their feet. I want to teach the girls that they can maintain the same attitude without placing their feet improperly and without ruining their shoes.” Denise herself claims she had the same posture-walking problem she's trying to correct in other girls. “Then my father threatened to tic a board to my waist and back to keep me pulled up.\" Dancing lessons, which she first started at age 20, helped stretch her spine (she went from 5 fool 5 3/4 to 5 foot 7) and further improved her posture and corrected her walk. On the other hand, she asserts there's no need to do what so many black charm schools have done . . . tried to impose white beauty standards and a white walk an black girls. \"These girls who HOCHIS NEW FEATURE Proverbs may be taken as an oppropriate implement that enables people to get an idea of the manners and customs of a nation.

Foster Seeking Greene Fields BALTIMORE (AP) - Bob Foster, after having successfully defended his light heavyweight title for the fourth time, says he thinks it’s time to move on to bigger and greener pastures — namely, heavyweight champion Joe Frazier. “That money sounds good to me,” Foster said of a bout with Frazier. “But I’ll fight anyone when the money sounds good to me. I’d fight King Kong if the money’s right.” Foster picked up 40 per cent of the gate Saturday night in the Civic Center—$14,000 after he chased Mark Tessman 10 round before stopping the young Texan. Foster’s performance, however, didn’t create an overwhelming demand for him to step up into Frazier’s heavyweight division although it is likely the two will meet this fall, probably in September. Yank Durham, manager of Frazier, was at ringside and said afterwards: \"Foster did not impress me at all, but we have gone this far with negotiations and I will give him a shot of the title.\" MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1970"

    "paragraphs": "The Hawaii Hochi, Tuesday November 3, 1981 those old darlings know all the tricks By Hugh A. Mulligan — AP Special Correspondent ABOARD SS STATENDAM OFF ALASKA (AP) — Those old darlings who must go down to the seas again and again in cruise ships learn a thing or two about the territorial imperative that would bring a blush of envy to the cheeks of an admiralty lawyer. For them, half the fun of a voyage is staking out a deck chair near the pool but beyond the splash line, holding down seats for friends in the movie house against all invaders, lining up in advance tables just off the dance floor for the horse races or the big crew show, being near the lounge door for a quick exit after bingo and first in line at any port when the purser comes on the horn with “all ashore that’s going ashore.” Sailing aboard a trim and yar liner may seem like a relaxing experience, but one must be on one’s toes all the time or lose out in a rat race that even rats wouldn’t have the stamina to enter. Some of the grande dames who are my shipmates on the SS Siaiendan have buried a fourth husband or are still mourning the passing of their first with an 11th cruise to exotic climes. “There are widows on board who have been at sea ten times longer than I have,” observed a young ship’s engineer from Haarlem in the Netherlands as we both watched the gala farewell floor show from a corner of the bar. Several of the old dears who sat with us at the second sitting in the dining hall two decks below had reserved seats for the show by the clever ruse of placing an old handbag on chairs up front even before the first dinner setting. Seeing the handbags, those searching for places in the lounge would think their owners were up dancing or off to the loo. Piracy is still a problem on the bounding main, with all sorts of bounders trying to grab off the best places for the midnight buffet, skeet shooting from the aft deck, the children’s costume party in the forward lounge. A chap with his wits about him and not prone to mal de mer can learn a good deal about the rules of the sea from watching an old pro at work. Your real cruise veteran on the first day aboard makes an appointment at the beauty parlor or the barbershop for the penultimate day out, knowing that everyone will try to crowd in then in anticipation of the captain’s farewell party. Oh yes, at the captain's welcoming party, your experienced passenger goes straight to the bar before the jamup and then joins the receiving line, having placed his (more likely her) drink at a table near the hor d’oeuvres. bottle deposit bill vetoed BOSTON (AP) — Citing increased costs to consumers and an “unnecessary intrusion by government in the marketplace,” Gov. Edward King has vetoed a bill that would require nickel and dime deposits on all beer and soft drink containers. King’s action Friday was attacked immediately by conservationists and Lt. Gov. Thomas P. O’Neill III, who said King “has proven once again that he won’t make tough decisions that are opposed to big business.” A vote to override the veto appears to be within reach in the Legislature. The bottle bill would cost Massachusetts consumers at least $100 million a year, King said, and he likened it to. “a new form of taxation.” He said the extra expense would result from new costs forced on the beverage industry, which fought the legislation. OF TRAVEL BLACK AMERICANS HELPED SHAPE THE NATION Belatedly, yet proudly, our country has come to realize the important role of black Americans in our nation’s history. This pride is especially evident in the state of Virginia—which today boasts native sons ranging from humanitarian Booker T. Washington to tennis superstar Arthur Ashe. In northern Virginia, the Alexandria Society for the Preservation of Black Heritage has identified several important landmarks. In the course of a short walking tour, visitors can see the city’s earliest black churches, the Alexandria slave pen, and a group of buildings designed by black architect George Seaton. ‘ Black roots go deep in Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth. Here many black lawyers, bankers, performers and educators got their start in Jackson Ward, the oldest black neighborhood in America. Today some Jackson Ward homes have been renovated, including the Maggie Walker House, now a National Historic Landmark. Maggie Walker was prominent in the business and charitable activities of the Richmond black community at the turn of the century. A founder and guiding force in many organizations, she is believed to have been the first woman bank president in the United States. Her twostory, Victorian house has been preserved essentially as it was when she died, complete with all of its furnishings and many of her personal effects. Not far away is Second Street, known as the Wall Street of Black America. Here you can see The Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, formed from four black-operated banks, including the one founded by Maggie Walker. .Downtown Richmond was Vs : 1 £-5 J i ' The beloved Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, born at Richmond : where he is memorialized in monument at right above, is one of a number of black Virginians who attained national i and international renown. At left, Robinson is seen in one f of his most successful films, dancing with Shirley Temple. , also the old neighborhood I of “Bojangles” Bill Robini son, the legendary tap dan- ; cer. Today a handsome stai tue stands at the corner of - Adams and Leigh Streets in i his honor.. s Yet another black Viri ginian—a slave named James • Armistead—gained recognition as a valuable spy for • the American forces under General Lafayette. Armii stead was granted his free- ' dom after the Revolution, । and today his portrait hangs in Richmond’s Valentine - Museum. Located in southeast Virginia is Hampton Institute, one of the earliest and most distinguished educational institutions for blacks in the United States. The school had its beginnings in 1868 On a farm where the Federal Government ran a hospital during the Civil War. The school’s goal was to train selected young blacks “who should go out and teach and lead their people, first by example . . .” Booker T. Washington was a Hampton alumnus. Interested visitors can tour Washington’s birthplace, the Burroughs Planta- 1 tion, near Rocky Mount. - Today the site consists of a - Visitor Center, plus recon- - structed slave cabin, blackf smith shed, and barns for i tobacco and horses. Booker T. Washington lived here as - a slave for 9 years and often s referred to the experience in - later life. J Black history is also much _ in evidence at Hampton’s Fort Monroe. Here abolitionist Harriet Tubman • served as a nurse. Here also ’ General Butler issued his ! famous “ contraband -ofwar” dictum, which resulted in the liberation of thousands of blacks over a year before Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. Then, in the summer of 1861, the first black men were enlisted in the Union Navy at Fort Monroe. Today a permanent exhibit on black history is on view in the fort’s Casemate Museum.

Fresno whores help out FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — Fresno County has enlisted the help of prostitutes in an effort to stem the rising number of gonorrhea cases. The county health department is issuing cards to prostitutes declaring them free of venereal disease and suggesting repeat examinations every two weeks, said clinic investigator Marilyn Mitchell. The cards are not an official blessing for the world’s oldest profession, he said, but an effort of gonorrhea that shows no symptoms in men.

All but two of the top 20 teams In the current UPI ratings are in the bowl line-up. The potential is there for a Shuffle every bit as shocking as a year ago. At that time, Ohio State plunged from Number One to Number Four by losing to UCLA tn the Rose Bowl and Arizona State jumped from seventh to second by completing its perfect season with a victory over Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. West Virginia and Southern California moved into the top 20 while Kansas, Florida and Colorado and Tulsa were bumped from the list. At least four teams, and maybe five, have a shot at Number One this season. Top-ranked Pittsburgh, 110, going into the Sugar Bowl has been a strong vote-getter throughout the month of November on the basis of its perfect record. But the Panthers need a victory to stay on top. If Pitt stumbles against fourth ranked Georgia on New Year’s, all sorts of dandy combinations will confront the voters.

And, if Georgia were to score an impressive win over Pittsburgh, there might be room at the top for the Bulldogs. Then there’s fifth-ranked and unbeaten Maryland.

Laughter predominated. These recordings would seemingly indicate that Pryor’s humor is stereotyped and superficial. But the beginning and ending of the second side of “Bicentennial Nigger” show that Pryor’s humor can be biting and bit- . ter as he expresses his fear of the future and hatred of the past. . At the start of the second 1 side, Pryor says, “I don’t like movies when there are no niggers in them.” He : refers to “Logan's Run,” a movie about life 300 years from now, and comments, “There ain’t no niggers in It!

    "paragraphs": "Thursday April 13,1972 THE HAWAII HERALD by David DeLeon For the past few months the Honolulu Community has been treated to the accounts of Koji Ariyoshi's travels in the People's Republic of China. To a newcomer, Ariyoshi does not seem to be anyone special. But Kamaainas know him. Koji Ariyoshi has been in the focus of controversial political storms in the islands more than once. * To look at Ariyoshi, 58, working in his florist shop on Nahua Street in Waikiki it is easy to pass him off as a typical nisei merchant trying to make his small business turn over a profit. But Ariyoshi is anything but a \"typical\" man. His past has been a stormy one and he is a man who does not believe in just minding his own business. He watches the world around him and speaks his own mind. Because Ariyoshi insists on the right to speak his mind, troubles are not unfamiliar to him. The ideas Ariyoshi speaks of are not typical of his generation. They are the ideas and ideals of today's radical youth; ideals that were dangerous to have in the past and are not wholely accepted today. one, couldn't ever be a foreman. And there on Tobacco Road were those poor white share-croppers. It was an education in itself. \"A minister's wife told me something there that I have never forgotten. She said that Tobacco Road is a belt of poverty that stretches around the world,\" Ariyoshi said. Koji Ariyoshi grew up in the Kona district of the Big Island. In the thirties, he went to work as a longshoreman and also attended the University of Hawaii. Before he graduated from college he was given an opportunity to go study at the University of Georgia where he finally got his degree. Not long after he graduated from college Ariyoshi found himself with millions of others caught in the holocaust known as World War II. But he saw a different view of the war than most of the Americans that served. He saw it from a cave in Yenan in Northwestern China. Ariyoshi had been sent to Yenan to study the communists' methods in psychological warfare. There he lived among the communist leadership for a year and a half. Last winter, he returned to mainland China and the accounts he filed of his travels have been glowing to say the least. the Communist Party, despite the fact the paper does not make this admission.\" The committee used as evidence the fact that Record had taken stands agianst the FBI and the Committee on un-American activities. It also damned the Record as communist because it consistenly backed the ILWU and UPW in their fights to improve the working man's plight in Hawaii. By those standard today, most of best newspapers in the country would have to be considered communist. The early fifties was a black period for politics in America but when he talks about it Koji Ariyoshi gets a gleam in his eye. His experience in Georgia are still, hard with Ariyoshi today. While he had been used to the racial inequality in the islands, the intensity of the white racism in the South against the blacks left a strong impression on him. \"I wasn't treated like a black but it was obvious that I wasn't considered equal to a white either. The blacks had a hard life. Black men weren't allowed to walk on the same side of the street as a white woman. If a black didn't get off the sidewalk when a white woman came his way he would be pushed off. If a black wanted coffee from a restaurant, he had to go around to the rear and hand in a empty mile bottle to a cook,\" Ariyoshi said. \"China today is like one huge family whose members are willing to pitch in together for the common good. The youth of China are very motivated, socialist motivation, and they are going to build China. You don't find Tobacco Roads in China today. \"In those days we had to struggle. Once we were trying to get advertisers for a special edition and, would you believe it, the Governor went on the radio to tell people not to advertise in the Record. \"The Great Cultural Revolution was good for China. It helped do away with selfishness. It brought the farmer and factory workers together. It brought the city and country close to each other. It helped close the gap between men and women in Chinese society,\" Ariyoshi said. Still his strongest impression of the South was of the famous Tobacco Road. \"The wives of haole foremen formed groups on the Big Island and went around bullying little oriental shop keepers, threatening them against advertising in our paper. But with strong help from the labor unions we were able to get plenty of ads.\" \"The students at the University told me there \"was no place like Tobacco Road, so I went to see for myself.” What he saw was poverty at its lowest level. On Tobacco Road people ate anything that would keep them going one more day. The faces of the people he met were sunken and their stomachs were bloated. There was only one person in the whole area who had graduated from high school. The only work available was share-cropping. After the war, Ariyoshi became actively involved in the labor movement in Hawaii and became widely known as the editor of a radical weekly newspaper, the Honolulu Record. In the early fifties he was indicted along with Jack Hall and five others as communist subversives under the Smith Act. A later commission witch-hunting communists in Hawaii expressed its concern over Ariyoshi's ability to get support: \"Koji Ariyoshi, editor of the Record, was justly convicted of a felony identifying him with adherents of a potential enemy of the United States. More than anything else, what shocked Ariyoshi the most was the fact that these people were whites. The congressional committee on un-American activities viewed the Record this way: \"The commission is deeply concerned that persons in Hawaii not only support the Record with paid advertising but have increased that support since Editor Ariyoshi and others connected with the Record were convicted of conspiracy to teach ''The committee on un-American activities, after analysis and investigation of the Honolulu Record draws the inevitable conclusion that the Honolulu Record is a front for \"In Hawaii, a white man could get a job as a foreman just because he was white. A non-white, even a pretty clever Koji Ariyoshi, an 'atypical' florist and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence.\" Ariyoshi's conviction as a subversive was thrown out in Appeals court. Was his paper a communist front? \"You could say that we were a bit anti-establishment,\" Ariyoshi said. The once editor is a florist today. But Ariyoshi has kept a close watch on events and is quick with his editoriaL comments. Ariyoshi sees the war in Southeast Asia this way: \"It is a lot like the Chinese revolution. The South Vietnamese government is the same as the Kuomintang, corrupt and without popular support. It's bound to fail.\" On conditions in Hawaii now where the labor unions dominate political power: \"There is a lot of city and state can do that it isn't being done. When the gap betwen the haves and the have-nots continues to grow like it has done here, then the needs of the people are not being served. Kalama Valley and Ota Camp are examples of this. The people who built the land are being denied an existence.\" \"Our economy is misdirected. When we have to live off of military expenditures we are living on the suffering and destruction of Southeast Asia. The big estates are protected from taxes and the workers and farmers are left holding the tax bag. Our lands are being misused. Most of the produce that has to be sent here from the mainland could be grown right here. In China, people don't waste land like we do. I even saw the land right next to runways being used to grow vegetables.\" Ariyoshi sees encouragement in today's youth. \"I've watched and even MS _ » ■ » W . . . . • • w t I -w .... ■ I - - \\ ♦ * • * I i ' BHfesB U 4 U F w- ' saraBH^ ' ■HHHRRIIRRRRRHHRMHRHRKIiO- participated as a community adviser in this blow up at the University over ethnic studies. The kids are forcing the University to give them a decent education. In my day the students didn't dehnand and the education we got was junk. \"There is too much politics going on between the faculty and the administration. I think the administration wants to have all the say over this ethnic studies thing. Some faculty members think because they got a degree they can teach anything. But the students have confronted them and now have the initiative. That's good.\" How does Koji Ariyoshi view the future? \"We're living in a decadent society. People speak of freedom but what freedom do we have? \"We are living on the verge of anarchy and need to reorder our whole society. The older generation, who has lived with the corruption of the past, can't be expected to change things. \"It is the youth who are still free from the commitments of life that can work for a better society. \"When friends of mine complain about a kid's long hair, I tell them not to think about his hair but the ideas that are in his head ” ms ncau.

SHAW VATICAN CITY (UPI) - Pope Paul VI is boldly telling Italy’s Roman Catholics not to vote Communist in the June 20-21 national elections. But the way he has gone about it has caused dismay to some of his bishops and to the Vatican-backed Christian Democrats, who feel the Pope’s intervention may backfire. , The West’s largest Communist Party complains of Vatican interference in Italy’s political affairs but tethers its protest there. It abhors a head-on confrontation with the church. Pope Paul and the Vatican see things otherwise. They have rolled out their heaviest artillery, from excommunication threats to arguments about Christianity’s incompatibility with Marxism. • They are blasting away to try to keep the Christian democrats in power. They admit the Christian Democrats, tainted by corruption charges and three decades of progressively decaybig rule, are not paragons of good government. But they say the question is One of changing the men, not betraying the ideals. * “The patrimony of the faith cannot be subjected to mimicry and compromise,” Pope Paul recently told the annual assembly of Italy’s bishops. “It cannot lie connected with views totally and intrinsically opposed to its nature.” The Pontiff said he fully supported a “brotherly warning” by Cardinal Antonio Poma, president of the Bishops’ Conference, that six dissident Catholics running as independents on the Communist ticket faced excommunication. The assembly finally “unanimously” approved Poma’s pronouncement, but not before many bishops questioned its timing, wording and the lack of any advance consultation. The Pope, in fact, had told Poma exactly what to say. Even the Christian Democrats indicated the 78-year- old Pontiff erred. „ Party president Amintore . Fanfani, a hardline antiCommunist, said, “the timing was not opportune. But these friends of ou r s chose exactly this moment for their decision.” --. r'Asked if it would prove counterproductive at the polls, Fanfani replied: “please allow me not to answer.” L’Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, devoted a full page to defending the church’s right to express a political opinion in Italy and Poma said: । “It is extremely legitimate and obligatory for the church to express its own preoccupa- j tion with civil, social and human order concerning the political parties.” Communist leader Enrico Berlinguer has pledged to institute “a socialist society that guarantees respect for all individual and civic liberties, for religious freedom and fredom of culture, the arts and sciences.” But Cardinal Ugo Polettl, that papal vicar of Rome, says, “Fascism, after pledg- r ing to operate with a demo- t cratic multi-party frame- t work, went on to force upon j Italy an authoritarian re- i gime.\" , 1 The Commwrists have < promised “maximum autono- 1 my” to the independent Ca- I trolic candidates, who say the - Communist Party “has made ( the most convincing analysis < of the complex problems of 1 Italian society.” 1 One Catholic candidate, ' Mario Gozzini, said, “the Christian Democratic Party { today is the main source of ] atheism and from a moral , point of view it is a Mafia.” Giancarlo Pajetta, a Communist secretariat member, said, “the independent Cath- J dies on o u r ticket are just the arrival point of a meeting with the Italian Catholic world which has been developing for years.” The Vatican isn’t encouraging such fraternization. “One cannot yield to any compromise for the Christian . with those who speak of respecting man but of ignoring ] God,” Poletti said. Serious Crimes Up 4 Pct. WASHINGTON (UPI) - Serious crime in the United States rose 4 per cent in the first quarter of 1976 but crimes of violence fell 7 per cent with murder taking a big drop of 11 per cent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today. The 4 per cent increase represented a slackening from the 18 per cent increase during the first three months of 1975 from the same quarter in 1974, but FBI director Clarence Kelley said it still was an increase. Spokesmen for the FBI and the Justice Department said there was no immediate explanation for the slackening. Kelley made the 1976 firstquarter figures public in an FBI Uniform Crime Report based on statistics from 69 city, coUnty and state law enforcement agencies. Seven “serious” crimes ' constitute the crime index — : the “violent” crimes of murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault; and the “property” crimes of burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft. Taken together, the violent and property crimes rose 4 per cent in the first quarter of 1976. But the violent crimes fell 7 per cent in the first quarter ’ of this year from 1975, the 1 report said.

Africa Spreads JOHANNESBURG (UPI) — .Riding by thousands of angry black demonstrators who rampaged through the black Soweto Township for more than 36 hours, late today spread to another township 20 miles east of Johannesburg. Police officials said an unruly mob of several hundred blacks In the Kagiso Township near Krugersdorp began looting shops and wrecking beer halls. A force of some 40 policemen was standing by but had taken no action against the rioters, police said. JOHANNESBURG (UPI) — Thousands of seething black rioters clashed with armed police, stormed build- ' ings, set cars ablaze and looted stores today in a second day of fury against the government. The death toll shot to 28, including four whites, and at least 250 persons were injured, 69 of them with bullet wounds, according to police. । Police yesterday opened fire on school children protesting the government’s regulation making Afrikaans a mandatory language in schools. Blacks regard Afrikaans as a symbol of white oppression. The riots escalated today, reducing the sprawling black suburb of Soweto outside Johannesburg to a smoulder- ing shambles with palls of smoke spiralling skywards. Scores of buildings were gutted and at least 40 trucks overturned and burned. Transport services were suspended and police cordoned off the entire area. Police reinforcements in armored cars and circling air force helicopters spraying tear gas onto the mobs foiled to\" quell the arson and looting, police said. They repulsed one attack by rock throwing and knifeswinging demonstrators who attempted to storm the Baragwanath Hospital for blacks on the outskirts of Soweto. The violence was the worst in South Africa since 1960 All Nippon Airways President Is Facing A Charge Of Perjury TOKYO (UPI) - A Japanese parliamentary committee will file with the prosecutors office tomorrow a perjury charge against the president of All Nippon Airways (ANA) over his testimony concerning the Lockheed payoff scandal, it was reported today. Seijuro Arafune, chairman of the Lower House budget committee, said he will ask the public prosecutor’s office to take legal action against Tokuji Wakasa. Wakasa testified before Arafune’s committee in March that his company did not have any option for McDonnell-Douglas DC-10. Others, including Wakata’s predecessor Tetsuo Ohba, said ANA, Japan’s major domestic airline company, had the option for DC-10 but cancelled it and decided to purchase Lockheed’s TriStar in 1972. if put on trial and found guilty, Wakasa would face a jail term ranging from three months to 10 years. TOKYO (UPI) - A retired Naval Self Defense Force admiral has been found to be a secret agent for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, the Defense Agency said today. Hte is Osamu Yokoyama, 61, who secretly concluded a contract with the American aircraft manufacturer two years ago and has been receiving $6,000 annually, the agency said. The agency said it did not know until today that Yoko- yama has been a secret agent for Lockheed, which created a political turmoil in Japan last February with an announcement that it spent $12 million in Japan to promote sales of its aircraft. Yokoyama became the second Japanese to be identified as Lockheed’s secret awnt. Xuhe other is rightist leader Yoshio Kodama, who faces trial in September on charges of filing improper income tax returns and violating Japan’s Foreign Exchang Control Law. Lockheed said Kodama had been paid $7 million for acting as its secret agent. Yokoyama retired from the Naval Self Defense Force in 1967 but has been in touch with the Defense Agency, according to officials. when police killed 69 black rioters in one afternoon. The violence today spread to downtown Johannesburg where police baton-charged a multi-racial crowd of students protesting police action in Soweto. The Johannesburg “Star” quoted an eyewitness saying he watched police open fire on rioters with automatic weapons. “The police opened fire without warning and I saw several people fall. I looked at them and three appeared to be dead,” he said. South African Army units Stationed three nriles from the township of about one million inhabitants, were placed on the alert. About 1,200 black and white police were inside trying to restore order. Soweto Police Chief Johan Greber warned whites to stay dear of the area. Scores of roadblocks were erected. Whites in separate southern suburbs a few miles from Soweto were warned to stay at home. More than 125 Macks were arrested. A police officer engaged in anti-riot action said “it looks ugly.\" Justice and Police Minister Jimmy Kruger said the po- । lice opened fire in self-de-fense only when it was clear they would be overrun by rioters “and their lives were endangered. He said 11 policemen were Injured and toree were hospitalized. Administration buildings throughout Soweto “have been destroyed almost without exception,” said Manie Mulder, chairman of the West Rand Administration Board. Gerber said the rioters were engaged in a reckless “pillage” of stores. Buildings with the entire township populations health ; records were razed to the . ground. | Post offices throughout the area were closed and at least one was gutted. i Bus services wWch carry Washington Considering Evacuating U.S. Citizens From Strife-Torn Beirut Remember Sunday Is Father’s Day NEW YORK - What do you know about George Washington’s father? Or Hitler’s, or Beethoven’s, or Pope John’s? And what did Ben Franklin and Shakespeare say about their dads? Just ahead of Father’s Day, researcher Sally Hopkins of Hallmark Cards has uncovered some fascinating facts about the oft-forgotten fathers of famous men. For instance, the father of “The Father of IBs Country” was Augustine Washington, an English-educated Virginia landowner who died when George was only 11. And perhaps it was William Shakespeare’s father John, a butcher by trade, Who inspired his son to write: “If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me. I had it from my father.” Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler reportedly despised his shoemaker father Alois, illegitimate son of Maria Schicklgruber and a man known variously as Huettler, Hiedler or Hitler. But Samuel Pepys, the 17th-century English diarist, felt warmer about his father John. On May 1, 1663 he wrote: “Advised my father to good husbandry, and to be living within the compass of fifty pounds a year, and all in such good words as not only made him but myself weep.” Composer Ludwig Beethoven had a father who was an unsuccessful tenor singer. According to Hallmark’s Sally Hopkins, he was badtempered and rarely sober, but insisted upon his son learning music at the age of five. At 15, Beethoven was supporting his family. Benjamin Franklin’s father? Named Josiah, he emigrated from England to Boston in 1685 and became a maker of soap and candles. Ben describes him affectionately: “He was of middle stature, very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled a little in music and had a clear, pleasing voice. He had a mechanical genius, too. But his great excellence, lay in prudential matters, both in private and public affairs.” By contrast, those words arc by Sir William Wilde’s playwright offspring Oscar: “Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.” Christopher Columbus’s father Domenico sent his son to the University of Pavia to study astronomy, geometry and cosmography. But according to Hallmark’s Sally Hopkins, the senior Columbus became angry when,at 14, Christopher abandoned his studies and became a sailor. More recently, industrialist Henry Ford’s father, William, supposedly criticized his teenage son for repairing neighbo rs’ clocks and 1 watches without charge, to improve his mechanical knowledge. The English poet Tennyson, one of 12 children bom ■ to his stem clergyman father George, once wrote: ! “How many a father I have seen, a sober man among his boys, whose youth was full of foolish noise.” Other famous men with little-known fathers include Thomas Jefferson, whose father Peter was A civil engineer working for the British government; Pope John xxni, bom Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who took his papal name from his father John; Bing Crosby, son of a bookkeeper in a Tacoma pickle factory; Mark Twain, whose father “Judge” Clemens was a Tennessee storekeeper and lawyer; movie director Alfred Hitchcock, son of William Hitchcock, a London fruit merchant; Charles Dickens, whose father John was a debt-ridden Naval pay-clerk and supposedly the model for Micawber in “David Copperfield”, and former President Richard Nixon, whose father Francis had a lemon farm in Yorba Linda, Calif. thousands of black commuters to Johannesburg daily, terminated their journeys short of the townririp. Thirteen buses were wrecked by mobs. Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, the political leader of the Zulu Tribes, said the riots would not have occurred if Primo Minister John Voreter had listened to tribal leaders at our meetings with him in 1974 and 1975. “But because what blacks want does not'matter, the government ignored us and thought as usual, they would get away with it. The whole idea of children being shot will give an atrocious picture of South Africa,\" Buthelezi said. Bantu (black) Affairs Minister Michiel Botha said it was too early to determine yet whether a change in government policy on the compulsory language issue will be considered. Dr. Horio Dies In Car Accident Oahu has recorded its seventh traffic fatality since last Saturday. -Killed yesterday afternoon was a prominent Honolulu physician when he apparently suffered a heart attack at the wheel and ran into a parked car. Police say 56-year-old Shigeru Richard Horio, a doctor at Kaiser Hospital, died in the 3:44 p.m. accident on Oahu Avenue while on his way home. He lived at 3320 Oahu Avenue. Police say he was the Iona occupant fa the car. It was Oahu’s 46th traffic fatality of the year. Leakage Probe LONDON (UPI) - Prime Minister James Callaghan today ordered an investigation into the leakage of top secret cabinet documents that disclosed embarassing differences of opinion between his ministers. The documents were published in the magazine New Society and outlined in detail the cabinet and interdepartmental infighting that ted the government to renege on a pledge to reform the system of child welfare payments. Although the issue was not of major importance, government officials said Callaghan was furious with the breach of cabinet security. Cabinet papers in Britain normally stay secret for at least 30 years. Callaghan ordered his ministers to tighten up their own security and ordered an investigation to determine whether a minister or a civil servant was responsible for leakage, government officials said. The version published in New Society Showed the Department of Social Security at loggerheads with the Treasury headed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey. Healey’s advice to scrap the reform won the day.

Kissinger disclosed today the United States would decide “in the next 36 hours” whether to evacuate Americans from Lebanon following the assassination of Ambassador Francis E. Meloy and a second American diplomat. In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, Kissinger appeared to rule out the possibility the United States might intervene militarily in Lebanon as it did in the 1958 crisis with a full scale marine landing. “We would be facing substantial force requiring sign!- ] ficant U.S. force. Our judge- : ment is that such inferven- ' tion would unify all elements 1 except the Christians against the United States, incur : heavy casualties and lead to . an open ended commitment,” . Kissinger said. Kissinger said that “no . final decision” has yet been : made on evacuating Americans from Lebanon or wheth- : er to plan a military or non • evacuation operation. 1 “If U.S. personnel are used,” Kissinger said, “it will be a very short operation. We ’ will of course consult with i Congress,” he added. 1 Kissinger said he would ' need to cut his testimony 1 short in order to attend an unspecified high level admin- 1 stration meeting on Lebanon. 1 Kissinger also disclosed ' 2 1 that following the assassination of Ambassador Meloy, retired Ambassador L. Dean Brown has volunteered to replace the fallen envoy. Brown had served as a U.S. peace envoy in Lebanon in March. “We will not accept his offer,” Kissinger said, “because we think we should send someone else.” Kissinger briefed the panel on the known facts of Meloy’s assassination and emphasized that reports that the murders had been apprehended had not been satisfactorily confirmed as yet. He said the culprits appeared to be members of a Pafesfiriiiari splinter group “trying to prevent a moderate evolution in the area.” He said, according to State ' Department information, the American diplomats were followed by a surveillance car Which towards the end of its journey inexplicably stopped following. After the follow-up car had stopped, the ambush occured and Meloy and his economic counselor, Robert O. Waring, , were murdered. Kissinger said the bodies were deposited at the build- ( ing site of a new U.S. chan- ( eery “with extreme brutality and extraordinary malicious- । ness.” Kissinger said the wife of . the Lebanese chauffeur received a call saying her husband would not be killed but , the call turned out to be false. ; BEIRUT, Lebanon (UPI)The Palestine Liberation Organization announced today it had arrested the gunmen who kidnapped and shot to death Ambassador Meloy and two others. The assassinations escalated tension among the 1,800 Americans still in Beirut. State and Defense Department officials in Washington said they were making contingency plans for an evacuation of U.S. citizens from the ' city. ' The PLO communique said the killers would be handed over for disciplinary action to the joint Arab peacekeeping force scheduled to arrive in Lebanon to enforce a cease-fire. The communique did not say how many persons were arrested or where or when they were picked up. However, leftist sources said five men were in PLO custody and two of them were rumored to be members of the Arab Communist Organization, a radical leftist Lebanese group responsible ' for attack on American firms, including a spectacular rob-bery-hostage drama at the Beirut branch of the Bank of America in 1973. sion in Kentucky. “You don’t do this for the awards,” Mrs. Devney said. “Everything I’ve done, it just happened. The only credit I get is I haven’t quit.” „ Needy Both At Home And Abroad Gets Assistance From H.O.P.E. NORTHFIELD, Minn. 1 (UPI) — Farm wife Verona 1 Devney turned an ecumenical < sewing circle into Operation ; H.O.P.E., a clearinghouse to I match haves with have-nots. Mrs. Devney calls the loose network of 4,000 chapters a 1 “non-organization” because ’ “it just happened, and I went along with it.” It is a clearinghouse be1 cause it doesn’t dole out money, only merchandise people 1 need and can use: even sliv- • ers of soap scrounged from > motels, retail store castoffs, > used tools and seeds.

Its headquarters is in Mrs. a Devney’s den in her home in it southeastern Minnesota, n There she maintains a filn ing system Showing where the ” need is, who is willing to help, s and the locations of church s missions and other organiza- : tions that will distribute the r goods. e “When I get a request, say, for shawls for three old ladies living in what amounts to a chicken shack from a missionary in Appalachia, I go to the file. That’s where I beg from,” she said. Mrs. Devney, who is 60, said she began begging for the needy 10 years ago. One Sunday in church, she decided to send $5 checks to textile manufacturers with an appeal for remnants to make for the poor. The initial response netted three carloads of fabric, more than she or her church sewing circle could handle. So she called on all churchwomen, Catholic and Protestant, in the community. The women began meeting once a week to produce a roomful of clothing for orphans in Vietnam. It also produced many friendships. She feels the shared rewards and the ingenuity of H.O.P.E. helpers have made the low-budget organization work. “There are a lot of great people in the world, like our little 80-year-old lady in Ohio who sells plant slippings to raise shipping money,” Mrs. Devney said. “These are simple, good people, proof you don’t need a fabulous sum to do these things. “Hundreds of senior cltl- zens have found a new pur- ( pose sewing and making , things for poor children. Right here in Northfield, an 86-year-old lady with a Pace- 1 maker has keeled over sev- ■ eral times at her ancient sewing machine.

    "paragraphs": "Americans say that they feel more comfortable with other Japanese Americans because of similar norms, values and customs. In addition to the characteristic of in-groupness, Japanese Americans are also keenly conscious of social-economic status. Japanese Americans basically aspire for good social-economic positions, and thus, do not generally associate with others who are considered low class or lack economic aspirations. Indicative of the Japanese desire for good economic and social standing are such statistics as the following on professional positions in Honolulu in 1960. Of the dentists in Honolulu 60.9 percent were Japanese Americans, as were 60 percent of the optometrists, 26.4 percent of the architects, 25 percent of the physicians and 24.3 percent of the lawyers. Japanese Americans also have the lowest unemployment rates plus the highest number of homeownership plus the best record for condition of housing. And of course, with the Chinese, the highest educational attainment. All these statistics indicate a strong awareness for social-economic status and the accompanying differentiation of others not being on the same level. The third characteristic which tends to make Japanese Americans stay apart from others is their acute sensitivity to color. Sociologists such as Dr. Samuels and others have indicated that Japanese Americans look at the question of “colored” people differently from the Haoles. Haoles, it seems, differentiate only between white and non-white. They work with a dichotomy of whether one is white or of the colored areas. Japanese Americans, on the other hand, deal in terms of more specific color differentiation. They view races and ethnic groups with regards to ho 1 ” dark they are. The darker a group is, the less desirable. For Japanese Americans, white is the most preferred color. Before the white man even came to Japan, scholars note that there was a strong preference among Japanese for the color white as beautiful. White skin was beautiful, black skin was ugly even though Japanese did not come in contact with either Caucasians or Africans. As far back as the Nara era (710-793) feminine beauty was described as “fragrant white skin.” Ladies of the Tokugawa period used parasols, and face hoods to prevent getting a suntan. They generously applied face powder and an ointment made from the droppings of nightingales to keep their face, neck and shoulders as pale as possible. White was not only considered beautiful for Japanese but designated wealth and being from the upper education class. Dark denoted poverty and people from the working class; that is, those who must slave in the outdoor sun. The color bias was carried over to the Japanese Americans in Hawaii. Thus, Japanese Americans are said to treat other non-white people according to the darkness of their skin. Japanese Americans show a preference to Chinese and Koreans who tend to have lighter skin than other ethnic groups. Hawaiians, Filipinos, Samoans, and blacks are not preferred and socially rejected because of their darkness. The Haoles, however, are perceived to be socially acceptable on the level of color but there are too many other factors which offset their acceptableness. First, is the perception of Haole color bias. That is the feelings that Haoles think they are superior to all others because of their color. Second is the belief that Haole culture and way of life is not as desirable as Japanese American lifestyles. As a final topic of discussion concerning the middleman position of Japanese Americans, I want to present an idea made by an author in Japan by the name of Isaiah Ben-Dason who wrote a popular best seller called Japanese and The Jews. Dason supplies us with a rather dim forecast for any group caught as a middleman. He says that the consequence for being a middleman in society is severe persecution and death. The middleman becomes the object of hatred when certain events take place. First, the power elite becomes weaker in a particular country but they are smart enough to leave. Then another power elite fills the vacancy. However, this power elite is not as competent or deeply aware of the country’s situation. Therefore, everything crumbles and the middleman is left to face the masses. It is the middleman who serves the masses. Assimilation, achievement and status can have oppressive dimensions Dason provides the following examples to support his idea of this sequence of events leading to the persecution of the middleman. The first is the example of the Chinese in Indonesia. In Indonesia, the Dutch were the power elite but they saw their power weakening and left. Then another power elite came in, not as competent as the Dutch, which was Sukarno’s regime. Sukarno started to crumble and the masses rioted and turned on the Chinese who were the merchants and middlemen. Over 200,000 to 500,000 Chinese were killed. Another example which Dason gives is the Arabs in Black Africa. In this case the British were in control in Black Africa. However, they could not hang on to their control and vacated. Next the Black African Nationalists took over as power elite. They were incompetent and fouled things up. The masses began shouting and took out their aggression on the middlemen Arabs who were the merchants, dealers and civil service people. Still another example which Dason gives is the persecution of the Jews in ancient Alexandria of Egypt. Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and set up his Third Empire. Alexander made the Greeks and Macedonians the elite, politically and militarily. However, he gave the Jews the middleman position of handling the economic situation, such as commodities, trade and general business. During the time of the original power elite, the Jews became the talk of the world. They became known as economic wizards. Indicative of their popularity was their Chamber of Commerce building known as the Diplostone. This was considered the eighth wonder of the world. However, over a period of 200 years, the Greek and Macedonian power elite gave way to the dynasties of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, who were basically Egyptian half-breeds. This started the downfall of the political power and it all crumbled under Julius Caesar. When this happened, the Egyptian masses turned on the Jews, killing them in hordes. Such was the fury of the masses that they smashed the Diplostone to bits so that there arenl The Hawaii Herald Friday, March 20, 1981 The middleman any ruins left. With Dason’s basic pattern of events in mind, leading to the persecution of middlemen, let us apply it to the Hawaii scene. The case for Hawaii may be as follows: The original power elite were those associated with the Big Five. They were competent, they had lived in Hawaii, they had intermarried in Hawaii, they had empathy to a certain extent for Hawaii, which lead to an understanding and sound control of power. Now, the Big Five started to lose their control due to the gain in power of thelabor unions, certain events growing out of statehood and the diminishing of the Republican party. Consequently, what followed was the formation of another power elite in the Islands. This power elite is basically invisible and not as understanding of the Island situation. They could be vaguely identified as power groups such as Mainland and foreign corporations. With their lack of sensitivity to the Island situation, there has developed an increase of unrest among the masses of Hawaiian society. As characteristic of Dason’s theory, the masses have started to attack the middleman because he is very visible and comes in contact with the masses whereas the power elite again is basically invisible. In many cases the elite are never in Hawaii but somewhere else. Increasingly, the middlemen of Hawaii today are viewed as the legislators, the planning commissioners who administer zoning permits, the various merchants and civil service employees. These people seem to be the targets of criticism by conservation groups as well as the so-called poor people. What is frightening about all this is the Japanese Americans, then, are the people coming under attack. If Dason’s theory has any validity, Japanese Americans must become deeply aware of their middlemen situation. The signs of discontent are becoming evident. Although in Hawaii, it is often said that all the locals would get together against the Haoles. A question to raise is: If the locals do not Tight the Haole, who will they vent their anger upon? There are those who say it is the Japanese who will be the most hated group after the Haole. As Dason’s pattern emerges and becomes a reality, this will especially be the case. Under close scrutiny the middleman position of Japanese Americans could be utter fantasy. But while the middleman notion is maybe a weak or inane theoretical construct to describe the Japanese American situation, it raises certain issues which the ethnic group must consider. Within Island diversity, no one group can hope to survive amiably without recognizing the equality and democracy of the system. If Japanese have indeed assimilated power and status, that influence cannot itself become despotic and insensitive to the needs of others. Absolute power, it has been said, corrupts absolutely. For the Japanese American, power and status dangerously can lead to arrogance and presumptiveness, giving Hawaii a future, a style, and a direction other ethnic groups might find repugnant and despicable. The middleman explains little about social realities, but remains a gadfly to recall that assimilation, achievement, and status can have their oppressive dimensions. — Dennis M.

Examiner KYOTO—To '.mderst’nd Japan one must realize that't is inoustrlal-: ly in its adolescence—and adolescence is not a plearanr phase to be- j I hold. ! The nation evidently I*nows what j i it wants, but doesn't seem to be sure [ 1 how to get it. As a result, its life • ; is full of vacillations —like the voice I of an individual during adolescence. The medieval md the modern, the ! Oriental and the Occidental, the | feudal and the cor.-.merela). Nirvana j and Coney Island, are all mixed up I here. j Life isn't integrated in Nippon—- | yet. The people seem to be neither ..what they wer ? nor what they're go--s ' ing to be. They take up new fashions. but folio y them in old ways. : For instance, the rich like to boast at least one \"foreign style” room in j | their houses. *here they can sit on j chairs instead cf on pillows on the , floor. But you wll notve that almost invariable they will out pillows j on the seats of the chains! To take j 1 another example, the taxi chau- j ffeur loves to race through the' streets at fifty miles an l our, blow- : ing his horn all the waj. But he steers as thouvh he were driving a I bullock-card along a country lane, zig-zagging from side to side, turning in the middle cf the block, and paying no heed at all to signals! Both Here and There All life in Japan is like that—nei-ther\" here nor there. n r rather both here and there. The engineer makes his calculations with the aid of a slide-rule—and checks his results on an ancient abacus!
