It appears that he regarded this part of bis functions p in a most serious light and devoted , extraordinary attention to it. The correspondents say that whenever he was not in the conference chamber the newspaper reporters could I always obtain access to him, ami he sucoeodcd at once in winning f their hearts. Wherein the secret * of his great success lay it is liard l to discover. Whether lie possessed some exceptional magnetism or I whether his show of kindly and patient interest won the hearts of Ilia interviewers, it is certain that lie did win their hearts. At the outset nine out of every ten corf respoiulchts were Itusso-phobe; at .the conclusion, nine out of every ; ten ewre Russo-phil.A very different account is given of the achievements of the Japanese En.voys in this field. They appear to 1 have adhered to the traditions that _ iroverned the attitude of the Mili* tary authorities towards the newspaper men in Tokyo and Manchu* 1 ria. We should hesitate to say 1 that thev were wrong, but naturally procedure so different was fol- * lowed by correspondingly different results. Tho Russians securr ed, the Japanese forfeited, 'vliatp ever advantages the support of the 3 press could furnish.

A very significant fact in cow uection therewith is the coincident* •rise of prices of most products during the latter half of this period, showing clearly that there is most likely some relation beteween the 【 act — one of cause and effect. 1 or many years prior to 188 8, or thereabouts, the worlds production of gold had remained tolerable constant — in the neighborhood of ope hundred millions of dollars per. year. In consequence of the action of so many countries in making gold the single and only standard of value, there arose an enor,momly. increased demand for it, and, consequently, it rose in price (is compared with silver and other products. This increase of price stimulated production. It payed to owrk old and abandoned Methods of extracting the gold from the ore were vastly improved. “Inspecting” wa» stiimtlated. Added to th(?M Oduaes was ffae VfUt .output of the Transvaal and thb Klondyke regions. Colorado abandoned . the working of her mines, and took to those of gold, with a marveloua result. The inprcflse in this flood of gold has been so overwhelming that, in the 375 millions of gold ie the world’s product 一 nearly 400 per cent, in fifteen years. 、 Ko wonder prices imve increased the world over I Mr. Carroll D. Wright, Comoi Labor for the TJuited States, fives figures to prove tho C08t of living lias increased between twenty and twenty-five per cent, in this period. In the disc .；odion of the effect of silver several years ago； it was claimed by the silver advocates that there was not gold enough to do the exchanges of the world, and that the practical effect oi silver demonitization would be paralysis of trade and the lowering of prices. Their predictions came to pass for a number of years 一 until the increased supply of gold consequent on its rise in price. Upon the other hand, the ,gold advocates of a single standard maintained that upon the ad- ； option of their views, there would ,result a steady stability of prices, with the least possible fluctuation. k Neither party wap. right.

But can sucli a proposition bo admitted ? 一 Japan Mail. - THE NATION AND TOGO. The Jiji Shimpo urges that the Diet should vote a grant of money to Admiral logo for his services. As for the objection that this would be contrary to the spirit of the samurai who held money in contempt, our contemporary insists that such an idea, is not entirely consistent with facts, for, in point of fact, it was customary in mediaeval Japan for a victorious general to make presents of a quantity of gold to his most illustrious officers. As Englishmen we naturally endorse this proposal, and we may supplement the Jiji，s historical argument by pointing out that the whole system of military rewards in old Japan was based on the custom of making pecuniary grants in recognition of signal servic， These grants did not necessarily take the form of so many coins or 80 much gold dust. They were usually in the slmpe of landed estates, measured by their riceproducing capacity. An officer or official was granted an income of so many koku of rice, which, in the case of any - large amount, meant that ho became lord of the territory where the rico was grown, and, in the case of small quantities, signified that ho was paid annually out of the official graneries, The system followed in England is exactly analogous. Grants of corn-yielding estates are not made, since the Crown has no sucl'. at its disposal, but grants of moiley are voted by Parliament, with the implied condition that they are intended to support the rank wliicli, also, has been bestowed on tlieir recipient in recognition of liis merits. The bearer of a title of nobility is merely embarrassed bv the distinction unless some moans of supporting its dignity are fortlicoming, and therefore practical England, when a man is niadc a Lord, takes caro that lie sliall have resources to live as a し n，<l. The same principle was rcc in Japan in the early Mei ji years. Thus when the Emperor a title of nobility, IT is Majestv u c nally accompanied it l\\v a sum of money, which was troatimI as cMitnilcd ])ropertv and spr•iallv to support the rank. We do not know vvlirthor 11 is Majesty observed this rule 1 in every instance, or its o])eration extended only to liK'inbors of the old nobilitv, wlio, though belonging to the 1 ranks of the kuge, were cMitirelv without rosouroos to figure in the world ns Princos, Manjuises or ('omits. We do not know, too, wltetlior the custom 'vas operative in all iustanees or whether it lias nenv fallen into nbeyanco. But it 1 is at any rate evident that if Admiral r rogo is to be raised to the peerage as a Viscount or a Count, he must have an income more or less commensurate with liis rank, and the Diet should not hesitate to make a suitable appropriation. The «Ti” Shimpo suggests a million of yen, basing that figure on the amount granted by Parliament to Lord Roberts. But England is not Japan. Togo 'vouhl be extremely perplexed by tho receipt of such a sum ns a million 1 yen. We imagine' indeed that his uiind will revolt against the idea of pecuniary reward in any shape or in any amount, but that is purely his own personal concern, Tlie .：! •! - ..1 、 、 .... .V*. mimm mms. nation has to do its duty by h\\A\\ irrespective of his moral idiosyncracies. * — Japan Mail. THE FLOOD OF GOLD. —f 】 ie flood of gold, which began to rise about 1888 as a result of the Transvaal discoveries a few 7 ear s before, and was swelled in the course of the next decade by the Klondike output, the Colorado contribution and the increased pro duction in Australia, unquestionably is a vastly significant fact. After something like fifteen years of an almost stationary annual product of about $100,000,00 0 an upward movement, began about the year mentioned and suffered no important interruption save during the South African War. By 1894 the annual output of the world was $181，000,000, whereas a decade before it aws $102,000，The figures for last year are given as $347,000,000, an increase for the ten year period of about 92 per cent. Xot long ago the Economiste Francais expressed some confidence that for 1905 the production o'vuld reach $400,000,000. Apparently that was a too sanguine estimate, yet another year in nil probability will see the outpu at that huge total 一 four time9 that of 1S84. As ilr. Vanderclip reckons, on the basis of this annual production in fourteen years an amount will have been mined equal to the world’s monetary stock of gold at present. But it certainly is conceivable that, despie any inference from the smaller increase last year than for 1903, the engineering and financial skill now directed to gold mining will yield returns which during the nex$ dozen years will average more than $4?) 0,000,000. Under better conditions for exploitation the output of Siberia and the South American countries may be expected to make a considerable gain ltliout looking to the salt sea for any assistance in heaping up the golden pile, and without ignoring the certainty that he movement will one day lag, we must accustom ourselves to a situation in many ways similar to that following the California and Australian » discoveries. We may sntVlv assume tliat the* : (juantit}，theory of money contains L an element of truth, and tliat the increased output of irold lias stim,ulated prices in nearly ev(*n- direction.

It is said, notwithstanding the lendor of the Japan’s victory over e great Russian fleet at the battle Tsushima, that many of the old are obsolete in pattern and That the entire navy needs general overhauling, strengthen- » here and there; 、 wherever a そ kness exists, so as to have the |l rc eet a homogeneous one. ne of tlie most interesting feat- : s about this new programme is : act tliat four large battleships 芎 re to be constricted in the dockyards of Japan. -Perhaps no other one. feature of the marvelous transformation which has taken place in DAI NIPPON within the last forty years, so well illustrates the natural mechanical ingenuity which the people possess as this daring confidence to buil4 battleships, of from twelve to eighteen thousand tons burthen with al that measn.\" To construct a first class/ mod. em battleship, effective in every respect，requires the summed-up, ac cumulated study and experience of all the ages. Un”l forty years ago, the Japanese did their small and precarious coasting trade in wooden junks, inferior in size, model and construction, to the argosies of the Phoenicians, in which that earliest of trading1 peoples drove a hard bargain along the coast to the Levant, from Tyre to Sidon, to the islands of the Aegean, and to Egypt,—before Solomon had built his Temple, and before Confucius had taught his eth ical philosophy. To jump over all the centuries, within a single lifetime, is what may be truly characterized as a peopled “jurnping out erf its own skin,” And this the Japanese have done. We think, this determination of the Japanese government to build itS OWn Ships 1S a Wise mnvA frnrr* several points of view : 1st. From an economic standpoint. It will give employment to thousands oi its own people, not only as mechanics who do the skilled work in the construction of the ships, but to sundry others in occu pations that furnish the raw material. 2nd. It will keep the money the government spends in construction home, thus accumulating a fund of circulating capital, which Japan sorely needs at the present time. Above all, and more than all, it will train up to the highest efhcieiv cy a body of naval constructors, engineers, and skilled mechanics, without which no nation may hope to compete in the firce modem industrial and commercial struggle. It was the neglect of this principle, more than to any other cause, that started Spain on the downward path, landing her into the lowest depths of lethary and national decrepitude. THE ENGLISH ALLIANCE. NEW NAVAL STATION IN - THE PACIFIC. The sincerity of the purpose of England in making effectual the Treaty with Japan, and the control by these powers of the Pacific ocean, is evidenced by the fact that the English Government has decided to build a great naval station at Singapore* There at the Straits Settlement, she will command the entrance to the China Sea at the south end; while at Hong Kong she guards the north end .of t\\}Q same sea and faces the Philippines and Manila. The naval stations of Japan at Formosa and Sasebo command the Eastern Sea and north of this lies the Japan Sea, over which Japan holds sway and commands the coast of Siberia and Korea. Thus these great allied naval power? will have a long line of stations at easy distances from each other and at stra-; tegic points all along the Asiatic Coast and the further advantage of HAWAII TERRITORY, MONDAY, DECEMBER 11, 19057 the stations on the east coast of Japan. The position 'of Germany at Kiaochau and the United States at Manila are at such splendid distances ' from their next naval bases that they are practically a negligible quantity in the control of Asiatic waters, in the face of this strong line of the allies. When the new harbor for the railroad line which Canada is building across the continent of America is completed, EngJand may there establish a station two days nearer the Orient than Esquimault, her present base on the East Pacific Coast and nearer also than any port of the United States outside of Hawaii. The Asiatic Coast and the North Pacific Opean will be dominated by Japan and England. THE RECOMMENDATION FOR HAWAII IN THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The President in his message has given much attention to Hawaiian affairs. The Islanders, native and alien, are much encouraged by the recommendation that three-fourths of the Federal Revenue； Internal and Customs, amounting in the past to about $800,000 annually, be expended here for public works, fortifications and education. It is suggested that this course be pursued' for twenty years. Should such a measure as is outlined above be passed by Congress, it is doubtful if any such amount as above mentioned would be realized. The Federal receipts here are nearly all Customs duties and these are paid by the Japanese and Chinese for the most part. Were it not for the importations for and by our people the Customs would make a poor showing. • Furthermore, there is likely to be no change in the tariff, as the President is silent as to a revision of thei \"...\" 一 Uovv it is well known that the government has twice failed in its effort to maintain the validity of the rate of duty levied oh sake and if, as seems almost certain, the final decision is in favor of the importers,, the revenue will be something over quarter of a million less than in past years. Again, many Japanese are leaving the Islands, and Chinese have greatly decreased in number. If the authorities can do so they will bring in Europeans and cease to seek new labor from Japan. And if this is accomplished thq goods used by their cheap European contract laborers will come from the States and pay no duty. Never, in twenty years or sooner, the Japanese are practically shut out or leave these Islands the “Federal Revenue\" received will not be enough to amount to any great sum, and taxes will have to be raised to a higher rate; or possibly an income tax may be levied on the.munificent compensation paid by the Planters to their (no, we mean the Government’s) contract laborers. There has been a great deal of cheap talk about the enormous sums of money sent back to Japan, but very little talk about the enormous customs and taxes paid by them. The per capita of Federal tax paid by Japanese is greater by a considerable amount than that pajci by the rest of the population, and the amount of money sent away by them is but a drop in the bucket to that squandered abroad by wealthy ab- VOL.

It is amusing to hear the outcry against Japanese \"merchants on the one hand doing business here and in the States, and then, on the other hand, the anger that is expressed at the suggestion that Japan may fix things so that there will be no show for an American to do business in Korea, Manchuria or Japan. There is no hypocrisy about the American business man; he wants the Japanese business men, ancUChinese for that matter, to come to his countiy only to buy and not to establish himself in business; but he demands that he, the American, should； be free to go to China and places under Japanese control to buy or sell. In other wofds he is unwilling to allow the Asiatic to compete with him on his own ground, but demands the right to do business* as the competitor of the Asiatic in the Asiatic’s own country. The American policy is to keep the Asi atic' out of the United States and the American in Asia, as much as possible, either way. An agitation is on against Chinese merchants in San Francisco, who themselves manufacture the products they sail. And popr old Honolulu is distressed. iti snots hprancp Japanese rr.er chants are selling to Europeans. t ervent appeals are made to trade at “white” stores (wliich have the habit of giving you less for your money). Our Japanese merchants are doing a good business with Europeans. They are not acting as philanthropists, but they have had sense enough to live economically and have not fallen into the habit of charging more the less they sell. People of small means cannot pay prohibitive prices to “while” merchants and go to Orientals, where they can get goods at a reasonable rate. SHORTAGE OF LABOR. SECRETARY OPPORTUNITY. There is a shortage of labor in the Islands. The planters admit they need 10,000 men. The attitude of the President and the Governor make it evident that no Chinese laborers will be admitted. There are always the Portuguese, we mean those who are * to come, not those who are going away. • When one-third of the plantations are controlled by alien Europeans, who are not naturalized, it is not to be wondered at that the Government wants to get laborers who will become citizens. But if the Americanization of the laborer at the foot of the ladder is as slow as that of the alien owner at the top of it, it will be difficult to tell just when these Islands will be canized. M Why docs the Govcniment take any hazard in the matter? We humbly suggest that there be a liberal importation of full blooded American citizens : towit: negroes from the Sunny South.” Secretary Atkinson ought to call on Booker T. Washington immediately. If these two great men got together they could settle the matter immediately. Think of it! What is wanted is AmericanSj and here arc States like Mississippi and South Carolina with more negro citizens than all others coml)ined. They arc in the majority. Out of these multitudes of Americans who are accustomed to field work in a hot. climate, what choice material for these Islands! Judge Dole may have his doubts about Japanese bom and educated here, but how august and venerable would he look as he might give these citizens a patriarchal blessing. Secretary Atkinson has gone to the wrong Washington. He should hasten to Booker T., secure a grafid company of these noble agriculturists of the Southern States and personally conduct them here. Then he could have a royal, no,, we mean a Republican, welcome, as he heads the procession, literally training “clouds” of glory as Re comes. Here is a hope sweet as sugar. In case the citizens of the South will not come, he might bring Simon-pure, down-East Yankees, already Americanized. But will they strip canc ? But we now offer a suggestion to the planters. If they are not carrie 1 away with a holy recklessness of patriotic enthusiasm, and arc still able to keep a clear head in the temper ate zone of common sense and desire to retain the laborers they have. Our suggestion is all sugar, as befits tliQ occasion — saccharine, not saturnine, — it is this : “Keep yourselves sweet and keep your laborers s'veet.” Treat the Japanese you have, and who are about to leave yCU, better. Do iui iiicm iike.you fancy you will do for those European choice people you expect to get. House them as well as you do Portuguese now on some plantations. And remember this, their labor is a commodity you can buy if you will give value for it. Japanese come here and work for years. These men are ambitious and faithiul. They work for years •vet find the new man, who cannot do as much as they, paid as much as they are. Thus the incentive to do good and better work is destroyed. They find it is vain for them to 1 be ambitious here, fo rbetter things, and the best of them leave in order to better themselves. Now if an advance of wages was made, to satisfactory and experienced laborers, after a certain term of years, and if such a prospect were held out to new men, we are confident that employer, and employed would dwell together in unity and all would say, “Blessed be sugar. Keep yourself sweet.” .The reason the planters arc losing good Japanese laborers can be found in the ftidiscriminatc way in which they are treated. Men who are in telligent workers, the world over, are ambitious; to meet their desires, to give fair and adequate compensation for experience and skill is at once the dectate of economy and that rare virtue, common sense. FISHERY CONCESSIONS l\\\\ RUSSIA. I lie. tenders for fishing privileges on the coasts of Japanese Saghalicn were opened between the 18111 and 24th of October. The results showed that the fisheries are Valued at a much highci figure than the authorities anticipaud. Permits which were expected to fetch not more than 3,000 yen produced bids of twenty ihoitsaiul, and whereas tlu* anticipated total was only twenty thousand it reached 52,000 yen. Tlic proceeds of the sale of permits arv to be devoted to public works in the southern part of the island, which, under Japanese control, is likely to make rapid progress. m rfi0£ M 痛み $ なく 21 Jf ¥- く之れ tsi jc* る . £ |' 法がわ 9 爻 € から無 Hi$ (c 大珙 〇 D 一拔刍取るには A びょせん 、 £64 1; も丁筝 4C11. 手 6 IC 治雉之て差上げ -^ ，- ホテ少街二 &' 十五畨 ( ャング 1 ブ卩 ， クの向ふ ) THE フォルガッソ ill • M M 開業 \\ 時計指輪 ^ 他何品 ; C 拘 li ら穿抵當 w| し掻めて低利 1C て御触池 1.1 候 ® 前以て郵 wi 又ば也話 i て御知らせ .| d 波下 rv は ' C 内密の御面谀 4; 脒 t-Ytl ホテ ^ «1 どユニォン町 <5: ヂ H J* 力 — pM M ~ J0 . 淸凉 M 上布料 lc» 「 アラピック 」 <0l gl! :^^ g や爻ビ新聞 iili R 犹 -CS 食驗幺間はれ -^ 販賣代 ! , }!• 店 If 7Tf :40 ■• キヤリブナルニァ飼料會社 ，-: 一 . タキ - X 街 & . .

PROP. & EDITOR ANTI-JAPANESE AGITATION In a scries of articles (none ol which shall ho reproduced without the author’s permission) I shall review and discuss the nnti-.lupanesf agitation in California, more particu larly the work of the Antl-.\\;duth League, a sore spot, in American Japanese relations. Honorable Mel lowan *s speech i* 100 long here to he reproduced. s< I shall give the gist of bis “argn menls” in his own words absolutely nneohnvd. He says: (1) “This degrading and vicious Japanese immigration, now com mending to pollute onr fair Stall by it.s undesirable presence.” (2 “As sentinels we look across tin Pacific to the Far East to ohservi countries teeming with ignorant and degraded labor: where harsl environment has made labor slaves: where moral conditions, the result of a cheap labor system, are dis gnsting and revolting; where labor is ground down in the dirt of deg radafion: where it is restive, vi cions and criminal.” HD “Tin labor of that part of the world i* not only cheap and nasty, but ifully satisfied when its physical wants are satisfied.” i I ■ If Asia lie immigration continues with itcheap, nasty labor and its had morals, it moans the undermining 'of onr industrial system and the pan perizaf ion of onr labor, that is now I be most potent and beneficent faetor in onr wood rubs civilization.' (•»/ We ol tin* (’oast are alarmed at Hie rapidly increasing Japanesi immigration now invading every avenue of trade and labor.” ((») “They are absolutely devoid of commercial honor; that falsehood is a virtue, that the truth is never used when a falsehood can he pre sen ted to their profit.” 7) “Sexnul morality in Japan is at the lowest ebb.” Prostitution exists to an alarming extent and is regarded with a high degree of favor as a legitimate occupation.** TS) “Out observation teaches ns that quite ; percentage ol the Japanese popn lotion is before criminal courts charged with violation of onr law The Japanese as a rule are combative. disposed to violate* onr law. untruthful, and vicious to a de gree.” ( !l) To compete with Jap atiese “means a surrender of man hood, a dest met ion of home, a debasement of labor, and slavery more onerous and degrading than ever endured by any child of sunny Africa.” (llh “\\Ve have now in like some of the American mer chants, are dishonest. But within j the past fifty years the foreign trade of Japan has grown hy leaps j and bounds and is making every i nation envious of her. (See Finan eial Annuals of Japan.) Was the growth accomplished been use the, Japanese are dishonest or been use they hold that “ Honesty is the best poficy”? Use common sense in your judgment. I low about sexual morality in America ? Are not wives made and unmade with an equal fneililv Who is ignorant of Renot The less Americans talk about it. tin belter for them. Americans an not particularly qualified to judge, still less criticize, the sexual morality of other people. The sitna lion in America demands all Itcii attention. It is not denied that prostitution does exist in Japan, as it does everywhere. America not excepted. Does it exist to “an alarming degree’’ alone in Japan ? I low about these facts ! “In New York there are -pi.non persons engaged in the slave .traffic within the knowledge of the police, In Chicago the vice commission counted 50,000 such women, while in San Francisco 2.000 unfortunate women have been consigned to the night, life of the streets, slave dens and houses of shame.” “The ‘business’ amounted to over $15,000,000 in Chicago last year, nearly as much as the sale of cattle. Thousands of men are today engaged in the work of solely procuring girls, and 50,00(1 such creatures live in the Cniled States off the earnings of fallen women.” Tims spoke Hahhi Marlin A. Meyer before the .students of the I Adversity of California. October 111. 1012. Met lowan's “observation** concerning the criminal inclination of the Japanese is not borne out in facts. Head the police records of various cities and towns of the State. “The Japanese are the least criminally inclined of immigranf races in America.” The ninth and tenth charges are the logical conclusion of the first four charges, staled in eloquence worthy of a cheap dramatist. Beyond this what can we say ? Head the Heporls of the C. S. Immigration Commission. Olmstead's \"Back Country” will give a vivid picture of the African enslaved hy the members of this “ wondrous civ ilization. ” As to the eleventh charge. .Me Cow an himself admits that his I “physically diseased and morally rotten Japanese’’ still have enough energy and brains not only to aeqnire education but also with it to “deprive yon (Americans) of (be means of making a living.” That means that Americans iimsl be mis erably a helpless lot or else that even (he degraded Japanese an ''lill •••juiil to them or **v# • 11 superior { lo '•\"•in. < Mlimvisi'. the Japanese c*otil«l not In- “rotten “ nfl«T all Tins is Ilia I-. iciil Conclusion of his j s l eh.

The plan to hold a Tokyo Industrial Exhibition in the 47th year of Meiji, was abandoned at the death of the late Emperor. Hut the matter has since been revived and there is now talk among the city anthorities of holding an exhibition in the third year of Taisho (11)1 4i, when the coronation of the Emperor i Voshihito will take place. The matter is now said to be formimr the subject of negotiation between Covernor Abe of Tokyo-fu and the chief business men of the capital. NO. 4f54. MORE FRUIT IN JAPAN. Taste for Fruit Growing and Production Increases. The taste for fruit among the Japanese people is increasing dong with the progress of international intercourse. Together with the growth of the consumption of fruit the cultivation of the same in Japan has had a remarkable development in recent years. According to the latest official returns the yield of fruits throughout the countrv in 11)10 reached 0H.7J0.44H yen in value, showing a splendid increase of 7,150.225 yen over 51.7)80,228 yen of the previous year.

The crop of all other fruits is yearly increasing. except peaches and chestnuts. WIRELESS TELEPHONE IN JAPAN. The first experiment in distant wireless telephone, made recently had very satisfactory results, and the Department of Communications is encouraged to carry on tin* experiment. Chief Engineer Torigata. of the Department of Communications, put up two posts, each over 80 ft. high, near the Ben ten bash i bridge, Yokohama. last August, to carry on experiments in wireless telephone. The distance between the bridge and the Communications Office is about In miles, and the voice was heard louder and more distinctly than on the ordinary telephone. Mr. Torigata will increase the distance in the next experiment and will try to communicate with a launch which will be sent out with two 20 ft. high poles aboard. 0 即 3116 站れけ 600(18 霣小卸货雅術美农日行商泶紀む仁 ！115！\\ 又 ，1)6313113 ！11 £11111 け ¢4 \\\\ .1181 21111！\\ 111101108, 36.11111[111 A^( た 11 ロ 1！11 げ 0 71011 し ’111*103， 157-159 6 【 八阶 $1 肝 [ 了 I？ ド 3 れ亡 ]! 5101*6 152 阽汕 N¥ 玎 .， 只 〇 161 211116111^ 01300, 痲病噸治囁新保證樂 1 屋弗吵艮到内用奶 ー 瓶一热洗滌器一個廿五仙するを得れば ^^ 内外両 1 を併用せば必す病甜を撲滅す軤從は一雇如何なろ讯從も一日 |： して撕さ去りニニ肽にて全治を敗拉す I 幾办 53 ポル奶如は妃似ぱの粑軏 |： して ”， 瞅の粑扪へて脱和ビが船して似舭肥の 1 榜ぎ ^ 3 ふ 1 溧 ：1 0 モぷ ％， ぞ ： |； ド 1 ふ ％ 、 郯れ ^ ？ 卜金五卵以上ほ 1 81！ 神頌能 ^ 議に ^ 4 病 ；^ し | に爽快 3？ 您漂は | 糸製 5 元ご待旳し & 0? 式を廉 0 こじ皈舆す米國 ⑯ 加奈太 ， 墨國一手特釣販賣移轉 3 遇 |1 末次商會 7 舌芑 3 给 00： 0 0 ，， 156 2 ？08 一 811*66 1, 8811 4311 2.83， 0^ 一 . 與 1 ざ日 ， た持之し 0 衰 I ごの那 1 購 ； #5 博べ #? 臼 ； 楔 ？ ら則 \" 同 -; 崧じ數 1 米 :: 狀 ： 目めら合 ； て火 ， 著て如 , 使 ！: 人又求 ！ 村ミて - 常ソペ ー ん 18- 艦 ： 痛 ： 個 ： 阶をのニせ半 ： 似 ， し友他 ；; 用 , 1 の者 $0 5 箝出 ：, が ‘ 、 本 2 に 6?. 等 1 を海 ： 止 ？ 今 -: 十た面 ： 並 ， く进 〔 - 甚 2！ 肫 ; I を本 ， 々 :' 速 1 者 ？ 囬ム N5 はにに瞒 :： 取てめ分文 ’ 4 大な 0. 龄ミ狀 ； だ物よ增ぃ ) ¢7 白 ‘. 1 か '\" へ '/^ 十竹 1 : も用 !; ひ 1 々ぐ - す - 早 “ 位 I にバぬに多 X をせ机八り ： 配 ” ニに使しゐ人 ： 全でやにんよ似 ， 、 ， 丨來パ治 5 !) む間 ： 全て !^” 個 ： 及 ： 祀て及 ；^ 來上治 5 水 X て 〇 致 V： ャ哲 ;： 店 I 转会せ又ミ日 ？ に治 1 ' 州 ' キなレ “ す哲 2 ジ店乂に氣 ， 全 1 皎 1 しス全 ？ じ其エし間みい 1^ しを日 :; 耍う以ぃろ非ミヨし近 5 も （ たぐ丁モ V 治 '， 白 ？ 奇 ， 只 ‘' 遒龙近え用 1 其ニ犯バく I てづひ痛 ;; 淦 。 度 ， ンを人 2 効 ？ 來ナ . 氏し來よを後 .： め或 ： ごの其 -： にマ日 ;；‘ 、 〈 去い描ふ ， は奶のに同 ； 日 !！ 白 ‘ 1 根 1 2：； 诹 ” ご ， 1 効 ？ チく候 ： 皮 ：!） ま ！^ れす , 紙船 /^ 〈 ム无せにろ坍 ； な ， 多 ：; ~ わ ，' ス技 ； 城 I に七し州 5 つ川々く 4 V の 6 和 ？ に病てかし ！） 神 ;： に な右 ； 籲配て因 , 食 ”， き船妃期 5 非で及ヤ # 成渭 ， れ治 :; 小 '; に 6 の ；/， に以 I 居 ^; 慾 ; 腿 ， にしビビ常 ：” 皮 ，3 し病 ， た致に守 ： 不ュ飢手てョ ， 和拟し - 巡々成 ： 治 2 の卞用い ： 配 . 致 1 ,: 4 ぬ又 5 思し破 ？ 痛 5；1， キ染 ； 全ひこ十心い肌ひ似に 1 ' 病 ， ぬ V けは竹 . げ厂通 ， 致 ';: みマ ， 丨は ， く炎 ， や餘 ‘ サ深 ？.¢1-， にた 〈 掛 \" 王典 ： ににのし時 1 ， チ籲 〇 無 , ミ心ミ “ 化年 ” 《 州卜れ描 ,； け三九 ： 人乂如ぐて神 ； 昼 , ミ々ぐス ， イ ；2？ 地 1 のす 、 もナ御 ；; の ， 遇ぱば小 1 四桑のん府の #^ 久 ： 染 I 迄 I 全 4 ぬ能 1 … れ則ス麻 ，. 席間 ； 治 2- さヶ潘効 \" 虹初 ； 敵 1 :6 〇 5 く ': 四く聪 ： ば ）!! ド申よ隹绝ごら … き … 能マ谢ニ妙め闲乂深 ;' 白で耻 ； 五津相 : 丸 ；; 胸 !: 栽 ;:# 上と全 ’ 擦け - 坩ぐ吹 ； 前て人の川す奶 ’ 候 ： く人又炉年 ;; 田成 ？ をん I こく石候 :； 〈 1 '' せ篠 ;， 加 ， 出 1： よ見大 ：： ロろのに相 ： 供 1 . ね前 X 貫候識ぐつ近 ： 4 間 I し船し物 . い處 ： 把殆 ？ 信义師し枕 ： よ一赉 5 用 ； か來 ?. 兵迓ンこ相ご色 \\ 致 ;. 兩 V - な - 與に 4 見父 ！^ じ I； I： 1) にしわは蔵な綺 1 が々 ： し脚 ， る作候文さ全 X 候 ！^ 吿ほ | 期 ‘, に痔 ， な 6 胃 ， 共 ； なの 6 虹 ’ 如 ， 御 !' 丨 ： 亂脚 ， 候 ： 劑 5 かし州 ？ いて ， 疾 ， ぃ便 ： 瞄 ， に ！） に ”； 疝 ； 痛 ， 和 :' 拭 ' さロ ； 氣 ， 實 1 : を 1 てに 5 祕 ” 贲 V ま下 !. 瞄 ’ な血 ，… ふ 1- №5 間ミてん日之七はにし腹 ： 九 , 1 ; ざ逍 ， トンか ’ 耗 ;: 如ナ其エか瘅 ，’ 維病 2 全てざ出 ？ 八パ通 V し能 ； たのを 4 侮 | 候 ‘.' 如 ； に 1 ' 年 ：； ン効 1 ' 三治 ’; 府洛 ，， 治 11 ん血 1 : 年 2 ロ . す - 廣 ： 蒂効 ， ぬ痛ン耐的永 5 4 脚 0 : ノ能く ' 遇 1 ,- 致 ;' ぐし用 I 大 5 もァ根ミ失 〔 村 〈 くも ” 丨 1-.№1 パ松治 ,5 此氣 ，， ゼに間 5： し勸 4 ひドノ ' 以 ^ ' ル本 2 通 ： れ御 -11;\" 候 ： 入ご下 ;. 府广州 1 に广 、 用 I 候 I めした苦 I 前 ;： ト的 ；！） 期 ;！^ み未 1 ， X； ' 如 〇 ニて鹫 ： ひし井たたれしか锄 : ' の下で - 中 “ 0''' だに中ま餓 ： 甬 ： 描入 ： 全え効 ;, ロぃ满又 ' でみら峯物う下げ坂す 1 パ 8； 四以 ， み山し用 1 脚ふ山候 ； に麻ム贞で聞 ;^ パ此三き田に裥 ， さ楓ブぃ调 '， 仇 , め麻 / 2 ひ 1 \"- ンし 4 中二之 0 , 一すにな ！^ れ叨和 ； はど一 4 快 ; >№1' をま吞 ⑴ たビ蒔疮 ： 皮廣ロの痔 1 11-； 靼 ？ いひ坊 “ ぃく ， る ^ レ七黹 ； き - 炒 ， 喊 ， | 1 ？ 臈丸 — 土針則一個三仙 0 >4 8^ 11 18 么 3“ 气 V :: 臂い 9 スい丄 VI 典 15 1 笋咕 ！ ？ 共 - 」 先生の發明にして世に嫌千 1X11 一 ^ ろ和なきは资緊の配ぞるあ |！ なる & X ん , ふ V い 4 、 やふ ，5 V んぢべんぴ ？ げ , 【 II ― 知 、 一誉性の打骐病も全治し便秘は通じ下痢 ， は止まり父後邪を治す (1 んほいてて 5 〜 111 い擎く 4 、 ニ 1 は ， ロ之了 0 くそ ，， ， 一日本の 1 にして觔能害 — 譯せ中蜃もせす白人社待へ夫れ I 、 そあひ ：' ねひ 5 、 しょ -. -4 ん .6 ひ 4 /-19 \\ ，^ 1^ ， 厂 '^ ょ - 夫れ各傅へて非常 |： 贫货备っ 1 弘 | 期 31 っでもぁ ； じつ 2 し 5 11 ら 5 ケゐぐ 6 \\ 5 |： 鉍 6 ふ - 一 I 4 、 1 く貫で 『 6 ますか货 |： 我篠府劑及び捋胳凡の疑なき不思通の効カは旣に | 4-2 浐 4,1 № 4 : 丨成んて 07 ： 仍だい |19 てん一良 |1 く仁ん 4 んだ ー 厂攻險原則一 ; % I ょ高 〒 此渚展 — し '^ の 44 6 掄へ诗 1 X 動ろ — を以て强んに使用せらる - に至れ 4 れ货に本州が世上 , , \\1 員一一人 、 ゎ肇鼇 ％/ て肇て 、 ざん 6 ぃ了 -1 ん 6 ん又鲁ニこ 2 そ山記の 1 に化敗 * る 3I^ は和て駆 I: 1 在 !>* 篠原劑定值五十仙一弗郵枕一個三仙 №1 !' い丨た ‘ (: いそし 9 け ？，0 〇 せい 1 令 \\ く |9 ん 1 2 ぴや 6 ？ く二ねいぢ ^ ん ， 本州の働きは人体の飢梂ご血液を消良に 1 循環を能くせしむろ |： 依 6 病哿を枨本 |： 退治全硭すリ V 4. っけひユびや 、 25 ¢> 1 けん 1.¢ V 臂肇 , ゐ — んけ #' は ， 键 1 八丨 5 ろ <1 くい ~？ ョ ー マチス 、 ^^ 脚氣 、 皮炻病等は効邸敁も速か |： 脊髄 ， 神敉笳 、 肺 、 心臓 、 肋脱ビ雖も全癒し 3, し ， 5 し 0 |， や 5 6，# 办い #: れ疒丨觭 4 』 ふ 0 ムひ ，5 $* けつれ V % 1.？6 削俱 ， 火俱 、 打摈なで 1： 至 6 ては沉に効果を頫はし婦入病 |： 用ゐて決して他の ^ 與の如く 2：： 肌を番するこごなく快疮す 12"

PROP, ft EDITOR AMERICA AND JAPAN American Friendiip. It wns ncat'ly throe-score years ' ago that Commodore I’carx 1 knoked at, the door of Japan and ! since then an intercourse between tla* I’nited Stales and .Japan lias ' existed. On I lie whole, it has been 1 1 very friendly. Hut more recently y these friendly relations have been impaired more than once. And the 1 impartial judgment must decider that America has been responsible for the unpleasant situations. If, America did look upon Japan with a fatherly love in the past, she hn* ; certainly been watching every act of Japan and, indeed, of every Japanese individual with a stepmotherly suspicion. And the average Japanese stands askance at this so marvelous change in the American attitude toward Japan. In the present and following tyve articles the writer as an impartial 1 on-looker. will endeavor first to analyze the true meaning of the past ' Japanesc-Amcrican friendship, second to uncover reasons underlying' the recent American .hostility to ward Japan, and finally to suggest remedies for the latter situation. It must ho said at the outset that 1 the characterization of Japanese- 1 American relations as “friendly” I is primarily due to Japanese. It- 1 indorsement by Americans came 1 much later. Now, if ingratilmb I marked the weakness of ancient I Creeks, certainly gratitude is general trait of Japanese. Slight ' est, acts of kindness done for then' have never been forgotten. And whether historically true or not 1 Japanese thought and some of them still think that Commodore Perry yvas largely responsible fo» ( ' the re-opening of Japan to foreign intercourse. The event has playi dj an important roll in the restoration of Mikado to the throne. Not only ' that but the chivalry of America i shown Japan in returning $700.- 1 內用期 | 瓶一典外用 ％ ー 瓶金一鳓洗麻雅一偭廿五仙 | 如何に窗症の麻病消讯患者も本和拼用せばニ三瓶にて全抬保捋 I 米國 、 加奈太 、 墨國一手特約販賣 ¥ 1 !! 末次商會 7 舌 5 1!1! 611 0 尸 ,1562 ？81 8？66 グ 831| ？31| 。 1800, €31. yvhen be says, “The Japanese evI erywhere feel toward America a peculiar, almost romantic, gratitude.” Then to America have come many Japanese students. Them I came in mntnet with the elite ofl elite Americans. A decade of perjsonal experience in American uni [ varsities convinces the writer that I in the academic halls are assembled Americans of the strongest calibre intellectually, of course, but morally as well. Their individuality has left a permanent impress on the mind of Japanese who studied 1 in America. Again, to uuote from Dr. Jordan. “The diffusion among lour American universities of Japanese students, eager, devoted and persistent has been one of the ! most important factors in maintaining the mutual good will land good nndertsanding of the I two nations. For everywhere j these Japanese graduates of American universities give a good account of themselves standing high in the estimation of then people at home, while retaining a keen interest and intelligent sym pAthy in all American affairs.” Thus it niav he elearlv seen that [the relations between the I’nited Slates and Japan have been friendI ly in the past because Japanese have been satisfied with the posi tion of beneficiaries. It was prim aril.v due to Japanese who appreciated Americans with gratitude. In other words, the friendship yvas not such as often springs helyv.een tyvo true friends of equal standing. And at its best, it yvas rather personal and not international or in-ter-racial.—Vamato lehihashi. CASSANDRA AND HOBSON. There is a difference hefyveen Cassandra and Hobson. Cassandra yvas a good prophet, hut nobody j believed her. Hobson is a poor prophet, and nobody believes him. It yvas on February ‘JO. IDII that Mr. Richmond I*. Hobson, member of Congress from Alabama. made a memorable speech of warning. He solemnly assured his felloyv members that yve vre on the eve of a yvar with Japan, a sudden war which Japan would spring upon ns unprepared, and lie set the | date as (yyeiilv months, within which lim«*Iim«* wc .should he attacked. Hear him: It Ih high time to consider what wo Bhotild do when this nation Ih Htruck — motnhorH may differ with me an to when that day may come—l will tell you frankly that, In my Judgment, you can count nltnoHt on the IlngcrM of your two hnndn twice around the number of montlm. In my Judgment It will 1 come before tin- Panama Canal Ihi completed. Put whether you accept my opinion or not, whether we agree as to the date, that time Ik going to come. This Nation Ih not going to prepare and the day |g going to come when It will be struck by a nation that Ih prepared. A member asked Congressman'! Hobson if In- meant to say that war would come within twenty months; and In* answered. “Yes.’* What nation did he mean would make war on ns? And he tin swered, plainly, ‘‘•Japan.’* Ever Hlnee this Nation went Into tin, Hawaiian Islands, the Japanese nation served notice that they would never acquiesce; ever since 1898, when we went Into the Philippines, and Japan asked us to let her go in then with us and w*- refused; ever since her citizens have come to this country! In great numbers and our people, foi lowing the natural law of segregation of races, have not given them the treat meat they thought they ought to have, they have been preparing for war Preparations have been going on In every department. If the gentleman will take the pains to look at It. whether for tin* army or the navy, ' whether for the merchant marine and the transportation, whether for the finances or diplomacy, he will find tin war Ih already prepared for and bar been for a number of months. We haw waited anxionslv for tin* twenty months I\" pass. They have elapsed now. On the twentieth of October last the dread period ended. We have waited sine,, over two months to allow full lime for the prophecy to eome true hnl not a keel of war Inis left the 'navy yards of .Japan. Hawaii is >'fill safe; the Philippines are undisturbed. .Japan keeps np the pre tense . .f amity. What will Hobson . do? What shall w,. do with Hobson ? When I In* prophets of t he end of the world missed a dale they put the day forward a year or two; why should not Hobson do the . same? And we will believe him. Just as much as we do the sue cession .if Millerites. Richmond I*. Hobson is a national nuisance, a breeder/of mis* • chief, a stirrer of war. As a prophet he is proved ridiculously false. The country should pay alien lion “nevermore’’ to this '>croaking raven, prophet, of evil, ’ that d ies not conn?, riven no Wali Dad “carried the curse of nnstaiiehed speech” to the Red t’hief Hliolnm llyder, and cried, “The |j Russ is upon ns!” And the Ued Chief put him up a peach tree with a score of bayonets under it to watch till the Russians came, or to fall on the bayonets’ points. It would not he courteous for Congressmen to point Hobson to a Washington pencil tree.—The Independent. HELP SEAL CATCHERS. Men Injured by Treaty Are Paid Compensation. • The conclusion of the Fur Seal I Treaty, providing fur the prohibition of the catching of fur seal in ! the North Pacific, which was entered into by .Japan, the United States, VJreat llrilain and Russia last year, hn.s deprived many Japn- ■ nose fishermen hitherto engaged in the catching of seals of their occupation. Consequently they were . nlnced in dire straits. To relieve i their wretched situation a hill was •| missed in the last session of the Diet providing tin* grant of compensation amounting to 1.120.000 ven. Since then the authorities concerned have been engaged in I lie investigation as to the di.strihulion of tin* compensation. 'flic investigation has been rejieently concluded, and as tin* resuit of the inquiry 127 out of 1541 . applicants for the grant of re 1 numeration wen* found not qualified to share in tin* allowance. Tin/ total amount of the money to he conferred on the qualified recipients has decreased to 0110,000 yen. of which over '15(1.000 yen is pav--1 able to fishermen who owned fishing vessels and used employes. ‘ 220.000 yen to he conferred on'lhe ‘ owners of ships as compensation ■ for vessels and fittings, and the | remainder > 274,000 yen • to the | crews of fishing vessels employed in the catch of fnr seals. The recipients were notified by the authorities concerned to apply ■ for the grant to the Finance Deli .partment. Sums exceeding fifty v i yen were paid in public bonds and Hums not exceeding fifty yen were I paid in cash. »M BUDGET FOR 1913. Tin* budget for 1013 is expected to be exactly tin* same as that for 1012, as the new cabinet has no lime to frame the budget >m its own line of policy. Hut the cstii mates of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce for 1013 is said to contain a new appropriation of 1,000.000 yen for the expense of participating in the Panimia Exposition to bo disbursed in four successive years, as the participation in that exhibition, is a matter contracted with the Cnited States government. TEACH FOREIGNERS JAPANESE. Movement to Create School to Aid Mutual Understanding. It has been planned by the •Japan peace Society to establish a school of Japanese which will aim at leaching foreigners Japanese and removing racial prejudice. In 1 order to put the scheme into prae lice immediately a meeting was held in the rooms of the Nippon Club. Ibiron Sakai ani. Dr. (ireene and Messrs, (i. Howies. 11. Fukn-' oka and K. Iliguchi and others being present. They mainly discussed the estimates as to its establishment and future administration. The election of the organizing committee which later look place resulted in the appointment of tin following ten persons: Mayor Haron Sakatani. President Dr. S Murakami of the Tokyo Foreign Language School. Dr. I). (' (ireene. Mr. (J. M. Fisher of the V M. C. A.. Secretary ('. J. Ar nell of the American Fmbassv. Professor Dr. M. Anesaki of Ihe Tokyo Imperial I'niversity. Mr. F \\V. Frazar. Mr. K. Iliguchi. Dr. 11. 11. Coates in id Mr. 11. Fukuoka. The committee will meet some time in January when they will have a more definite deliberation as to the I establishment of the school. 000, her share of the indemnity over the Shimnoiiseki incident. ImV touched the heart of Japanese peo pie. These tyvo events yvere enough! for Japanese to prostrate themselves before Americans as theirj onjin (benefactor). When Japan entered the era ofl Maiji, many sincere hnt some in i capable Americans came to Japan in the capacity of teachers, experts. missionaries and merchants I la* first two wore induced to come by the Japanese government by of fering them hamUnno salaries. The last tyvo came to Japan yvhethei die wanted them or not. We shall briefly speak of the part these| I played in creating the friendly re-' I lalion. j The profession of teaching has a social recognition and dignity in! •Japan to a degree altogether unknnyvn in America. A teacher, re-1 gardless where ho teaches,* is called I a sensei (an elder, therefore, a superior person to be revered) in, Japan. To students he is a bene I factor in the highest sense. American experts employed by the gov I eminent yvere eonsidcnll as officials. and officials in Japan also enjoy a social dignity as they do in (Jerniany. They were likewise respected by the people. On the other hand, neither preachers nor tradesmen a.s such have command ed respect because of their profes-j sion. while it is true that some ot'| them. too. have been and still are | highly esteemed but because ofl [their individual merits. Christiai missionaries as such therefore yvere j I not excepted in this respect. Fortunately. however, for them and i perhaps for Japanese, too. that most of them usually taught ii ! their denominational schools estab Dialled in Japan. Thus they have! been teachers as well. If yvo except tradesmen. Americans in Japan won* those engaged iu the professions that placed them in a position of respect in the eye of Japanese people. It may In here remarked that a profession has more weight than his nationality or race in Japan. The negro if placed in the same position would have enjoyed the same dignity Whatever that may he because of the professions of most Americans.' they were considered Japanese on (jin. Dr. Jordan rightly observe* OIL IN JAPAN. • The waxes and oils produced in Japan reach twenty million yen in lvalue annually, rape seed oil representing 8,000,000 yen, fish oil 3.500,000 yen, wood wax 2.500.000 yen. eno-abura (pcrilla orimoides) 000,000 yen and bean oil 500.000 yen. The amount exported up to a few years ago was between six and seven million yen. rape seed oil covering two million yen, but since the year before last the quantity exported has been steadily decreasing. the total export having dwindled last year to 500.000 yen and that of rape seed oil to 200,000 yen. Under such conditions the oil manufacturers in the western districts arc now experiencing great hardships. Yokkaichi and 1 Osaka are barely sustaining their established trade, but in other localities. particularly in Kyushu and Ifakkaido, a large number of 1 manufacturers have gone bankrupt ami the trade is in imminent danger of extinction. The direct 1 cause of this is ascribed to the great fluctuations in the price of oils, which arc almost entirely re--1 gnrded as objects for speculative 1 transactions. The only remedy ‘i suggested is that those among the 1 present dealers whoso means arc of a solid, permanent description, V should unite in creating a league 1 for the prevention of violent changes in the market price of the ’ articles they are dealing in. A reasonably uniform price will reopen their means of sale abroad. ' MORE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH. r As a measure to prevent marine li.saster.s. the installing of wireless , telegraphy in steamers is very important. and tin* authorities of tin; • Department of Communications an? advising shipowners to make arrangenwnts in their steamers as • soon as possible. All tin* steamers on the Pacific service have already . been equipped with the apparatus, . but those on tin* Australian line • arc nut yet supplied.

Kobayasiii, Editor and Proprietor. RACE PREJUDICE. We ho VO heard very mueh ot.lnje concerning race prejudice. We have been told that this is the orte great, insnrnimintablo difficulty in the way of a belter understanding and closer fellowship among the nations whoso representatives dwell up and down Hie Pacific slope. Now, just what is this thing which we call race prejudice ? There are two things which form the considerable part of this situalion, namely-ignorance and artistic disgust. Ignorance ol the mental habits and 'social ambitions, and disgust with the strange pigmentation and contour of the faces of the people of the other races. Now the most troublesome of these two is ignorance, there is an old proverbial stanza which says: “A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring.” And our ignorance is not so much lack of information as it is lack of “deep drinking.” Of all the pits into which the pilgrim through this life may fall there is none quite jig dangerous us that of ignorance. Most of our personal ills, our famines and times of stringency, our crimes and oppressions are traceable to the deceits of ignorance. We are ignorant* of the laws of health, ignorant, of the powers at work about us in the physical world; ignorant of the mystical soul-life, and as a consequence wo cripple our bodies, we impoverish the land and pervert the natural and wholesome development of the lives about us by the misuse of the power of suggestion. If wo knew the laws of health, the laws of nature and the laws of the mind how much more of a paradise we could moke of what is now at times u very disagreeable world in which to live. We could make it a place, indeed, where it would be possible for “brethren to dwell together in the bonds of ponee.” Now the matter is not different when it comes to the question of the mingling of the races. We may know the geographical situation of a race, we may be acquainted with its history, know something of its language, have road of its army and navy, and yet this sort of information may ho the very thing which stands in the way of a com-1 pjete understanding of that race. We must “drink deeper,” we must know something of the mental temper, the reflective life, of the soulerics of that race before we may be said to understand it. For illustration, how mueh does the average Californian know of the lives of the thousands of Chinese and Japanese who live in the valleys up and down this Pacific Coast? What, after all, does ho know of those people whose industry has filled these valleys with the glory ol a splendid agriculture? In one sense Californians know them very well. They have heard about the \"picture brides,” the gambling dens and the dee]) caverns in our cities where are hidden away the spoils of citizenship and the sanctity of womanhood. They have heard that every Japanese working in the homes or on the farms is a soldier with his uniform hidden under the disguise of overalls and jumper, ready to be exposed at a moment’s notice; that every conk is a spy seeking information which may he of use to his government in time of national misunderstanding; that Japanese do not keep their word, that they have been known to steal and commit murder and these added together make very undesirable citizens. The unfortunate part of this is, of course, that some of these things are true and some are maliciously false, but no distinction is made. “It is better to know less than to know so much that is false.” Now it requires no lengthy argument to show that such so-called knowledge is not calculated to bring about a mutual understanding -between the Japanese and Chinese on the one hand and the Americans on the other. Doubtless similar misinformation is far spread among these races concerning America and the Americans. We are told, on the basis of this misunderstanding, that the. Japanese and Chinese are “different” and that any approach towards social or other intercourse is to be discouraged at all times. Such knowledge is really ignorance and such ignorance is the dark background on which the picture of race prejudice is projected. There is yet another factor in race prejudice with which we have In deal. At first it seems hardly worth consideration but upon further investigation it will be found, after all, to lie the most troublesome of all. This factor is disgust with the color and shape of the fane. Yellow peril, the negro problem—what are these but color problems? We dislike the Japanese because the color of his skin is yellow and the negro because his is black. Many young Americans .1 • a.B 3it 11 i{S%;i%!!S^ 81 ; !-| Sil 11 |\"« : lal;:3i*j I$%S m® «Ser 2H* ■*•* ««««*««; |j»\" f a* ffl i BpJ»|s|»||sir«ss; i i suites X | S§ii jj; + i + y| f a- ?? 8n sassisg ilizAtioD and all its achievements! Nobody takes this creature ser- ' iouslv. When it is mentioned, it is always in a humorous vein. While we are with the namatu. we might speak of the influence 1 this creature has had upon the architecture of Japan. “Specifically worthy of mention in this connection is the curvature given to the old stone castle walls. It approximates that theoretical curve known in geometry ns the parabolic, which gives the greatest stability against earthquakes, and which at the same time conforms most nearly to the line of beauty. As another illustration of how earthquakes stimulate architectural ingenuity, I may mention the way in which the fivestoried pagodas, some’ of them over a hundred feet high, are built to endure the severest shocks. These high structures have never ly-en known to fall. The principle on which they are built is the combination of an inverted pendulum with an ordinary pendulum, which is said to minimize the effect of any tremor. The principle is emliodied in a heavy, massive piece of timber, suspended somewhat freely from tin 1 top and resting on a pivot below, so that in ease the ground shakes, the whole structure sways in such a manner as to maintain its equilibrium.” ' I As to ordinary dwelling houses, Leroy Beaulieu says: Nothing can exceed the simplicity of the construction of these habitations, which only differ from ihose of the townspeople by their lofty and heavy thatched roofs, which usually contain a granary, and are supported by very stout wooden pillars, rising from a heap of stones placed oil the' bare ground, without any attempt at a foundation. Those walls only which support the gable are solidly built with clay kept together by a bamboo lattice. The two principal facades stand back about a yard inside the pillars, and consist of paper screens which slide backwards and forwards. At night, or in stormy weather, these screens are replaced by wooden shutters. 'I lie whole front is | thrown wide open when the weather is fine or there is a ray of sunshine, so that passers-by may have a full view of (he interior.” Finally, a word as to the fauna and flora. So far ns archaeology shows, Japan was never inhabited by monstrous mammals encli as threatened man in other parts of the earth. Nor have there existed: impenetrable jungles so common on the continent of Asia and the | Americas. Even giant trees have not existed. The fiercest animals ( the inhabitants had to face and conquer were the bear, boar and wolf. The lirst named were pushed into the northern island of Hokkaido in time unknown to us. Neither the boar nor the wolf are now numerous. Japan has always been a land of graceful trees, artistic flowers and melodious song birds. The pine mid cranes, the plum (awe) and I warblers, the bamboo and sparrows, have been sneh common subjects, of onr artists that no one has failed to see them. Then wc have the| cherry, wisteria, lotus, eulnlia, eamelin. patrinia and not the least, our glorious chrysanthemum. Maples with their fantastic leaves and varied hues add to the picturesque nature full of winding and sounding brooklets, beginning with cataracts large and small. Such in brief was the physical environment in which Japanese culture grew. (To be continued.) VAMATO ICTIIIIASIII. SHUTTING THE GATES TO THE FOREIGNER The Hurnett-Dillingham immigration hill is an attempt to reverse the immigration pulley of the t tilled States. It is just as reactionary as it dares to he. It is the first deliberate and concerted effort that has been made by “little Americans” to shut the gates in the faces ' of honest, healthy and industrious • Europeans who want to cast in , theiHot with the Republic. Tho liliTiiry test in the hill is a subterfuge—a very silly one. It is absurd that farmers and mechanicsfrom Russia, Germany or elsewhere —who are morally and physically qualified for American citizenship —should ho barred out by a spell-i ing book when they get to Kllis Island.

It is only by the most persistent struggle that these young men so trained are able to free themselves from this miscducation. Now. as that color shades up from the negro wo think, naturally, that the character likewise undergoes a similar change and its evolution into higher spheres is announced by this outward change, in the pigmentation of the skin. Well, under such tuition it is no wonder that we find ourselves face to face with what at first seems to bo an unsurmountablc barrier across the path which seems should lend to complete understanding. If it took the Romans two hundred years to understand the invading barbarian, wo may expect it to take some years for us to understand each other here on this const. We piust educate, educate, patiently but persistently. Wo must seek to sec each tie- other’s good and tryto live above the level of such prejudice. , Berkeley, Cal. HARVEY It. OUT, JAPANESE CIVILIZATION. Physical P.nvironmcnl. Next, we shall briefly speak of the environment in which Japanese culture evolved. Spencer, speaking of the relation of environment to the evolution of man, says: “Life in general is possibh ly between certain limits of temperature; and life of the higher kinds is possible only within a comparatively narrow range of temperature, maintained artificially if not. naturally. Hence, social life, presupposing ns it does not only human life but that life vcglal and animal on which human life depends, is restricted by certain extremes of cold and heuj.” But it was Thomas Buckle who was undoubtedly the first to bring in relief the unmistakable influence of “the gem-rid aspect of nature” upon human cultures. It “produces its principal results by exciting the imagination and suggesting those innumerable superstitions which arc the great obstacles to advancing knowledge.” Further, “Looking in this way at the human mind ns affected by the aspects of nature, it is surely a remarkable fact that all the great early civilizations were situated within and immediately adjoining the tropics, where those aspects are most sublime, most terrible, and where nature is, in every respect, most dangerous to man. Indeed, generally, in Asia, Africa and America the external world is more formidable than in Europe.” As a general sociological principle neither Spencer nor Buckle is to be denied, ns to the truth of their statements. With such a preliminary remark, we shall now examine the environment that • played a part along with heredity in the evolutionary process of the Japanese race and their culture. Old Japan was no more than 140,000 square miles in area, but was composed of no less than eight hundred islands of volcanic origin, “lying off the northeastern const of the Asiatic continent in the shape of a longitudinal curve.” Its climate is neither too severe nor too mild. The rainfall is plenty for cultivation but not too copious. The Island Empire, ns it might be easily supposed, is extremely mountainous, rising some times as high as the Mount Fugi, unique for its beauty and now famous the world over. None of the peaks, however, like those on the continent are awe-inspiring. They never terrified the inhabitants nor have they rendered them to remain passive. Nature was to be enjoyed; it was not to conquer the islanders. The insular nature of the land makes it at once obvious that water everywhere surrounds it. Its eastern shores are washed by the gentle waters of the Pacific, while its western shores are washed by the intermingled waters of the seas of Japan and Okhotsk and that of Yellow Sea. Thus it was that cultural drifts, including man from the continent, were often cast upon the shores of Japan from time immemorial. To its eastern shores the warmth-giving Black Current brought similar drifts from other parts of the world. Japan formed a sort of oasis in the midst of these diverse waters and its inhabitants were or have become a sea-folk of Asia. The volcanic origin of the land made it inevitable that its inhabitants had lo face the frequent occurrence of earthquakes, eruptions and tidal waves, in addition lo hurricanes, tempests and what not. A glance at the formidable array of these phenomena as presented by , Okujimu in his “History of Natural Destructive Phenomena in Jn- : pan,” may suffice to shook the oversensitive. However, so far as the Japanese race is concerned, those terrible events have had only a ■ happy result; they stimulated the activity of their imagination but ■ did not “impair the intellectual powers.” To illustrate: “The very ■ - origin of earthquakes is ascribed rather jocosely to the movement of ■ la huge, phlegmatic catfish, imiiuuiij living in mud beneath the crust ■| of the earth. When its barbels twitch, seismology makes record of 1 1 fresh shocks; but should the hideous monster feel inclined to raise its Jbroad, glum head in its dozing on tin: muddy bottom, then woo to civ- ' THE JSPTOJESE AMERICAN ENGCI9H SECTION. \\m 0 i m fit m i lea. They have aimed solely at keeping unwholesome people from coming. The Bumctt-Dillingham hill is the entering wedge for tt new and bad policy—a policy of general exclusion. If this literary test clause is allowed to stand, the way will ho open to various kinds of captions and whimsical restrictions—all tending toward a complete stoppage of that tide of human strength and enterprise that has been flowing into this country from Europe for the last four hundred years, and that has made America what it is. Nothing is more stupid than the prejudice to which this bill makes its appeal. Tt appeals to the utterly unfounded notion that the social and political evils that afflict the ' i United States are due to the “foreign element.” The truth is, of coarse, that all of us, except the ; Red Indians, belong to the foreign element in various degrees of hereditary remoteness. And there is . absolutely no truth in the contention that the newcomers are more disposed to crime, shifllessness or any particular kind of moral per- ; I versify than the oldcomers and 11 their descendants are. 'I As for the rudimentary literary i culture, the American public. school system exists to supply that Hand no honest man, woman or ■ child should be excluded from the i j United States for the lack of it.

From the public addresses of these men one would not gather that they bad ever visited a Japanese community in the agricultural districts of the State, nr talked with Japanese merchants and baiikers of the cities. It is a pitiable comment on the mediocrity of the California politician that be should rush headlong into this dangerous legislation without giving a single day to serious study of Japanese character. Are the Japanese a dangerous element? Do they form an nnassimilablc factor? This wise politician never took the time to impure. Why not delegate some one to study them, both here and in Japan? What calls for all this haste? Certainly the future of California would not be seriously jeopardized by a year’s delay, during which time this matter could be placed in the bands of exports and a sane conclusion reached which could be made the basis for just and yet truly patriotic legislation. The people are uninformed. They simply follow their leaders, and \"if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch,’’ I_think itJs fair_to_say in this connection that no one wishes to injure the feelings of the kindly-disposed Japanese nation. N'o one' would willingly do anything to disturb the fraternal and peaceful relations between these two nations whoso destinies are so evidently closely bound together. Therefore, common caution dictates deliberation, (live the people time to think, hot the facts be known. Ask the Japanese themselves to cooperate in the settlement of the problem. They will respond. Witness the so-called “gentlemen’s treaty.” Witness the entire history of the relations of the two nations. God is not dead. Above man is humanity, and humanity d(invalids consideration.

Your statement In this particular Instance Is on a par with one made before your committee, or of the Senate, that It costs the Japanese nothing to live, hence they can work for next to nothing. As a matter of fact, they are extravagant to a degree, both as to food and clothing, and want always the best. Compare the result of this Industry with a like number of so-called white farm laborers. Here today and gone tomorrow, hut always to be found at the wayside groggery, not “sending their money out of the country,\" but leaving It where It will do the most harm, and leaving their brains with It. If honest testimony on this phase of the Industrial question were submitted before your committee It would Indeed \"be a blot upon our financial system so far as bur State Is concerned,\" with which the Japanese question would pale In Insignificance. Further, you say: \"The Japanese not only send their money out of the State, but do not build up the resources of the land they Inhabit.\" Their lands here, acre for acre, refute >our statement, and shows you have been misinformed. I do not contend that they build dwellings as good as our own,' but I do contend that they ; build within their means, and many of ; us would do well to follow their examPie In this particular. We are living In times of peace, prosperity and plenty, the like before unknown, but let I reverses come, which I trust they may j not, and many a man would find that hr did not own as good a shelter that he could call his own as many of our i Japanese. I must, however, agree with I your statement In this one particular, that their habitations In general (from nr. artistic point of view) are a blot jon the face of the landscape. I love a j beautiful home, and the average JapI ancse home Is not a thing of beauty jot a joy forever. i Regarding the perpetuation of the strawberry business here for which this poor land seems adapted, I know that Its continuation depends upon the Japanese, notwithstanding your state- ; ment to the contrary, which If you insist upon maintaining you must show your qualification for so doing. • My reference to the negro was mereily to answer the oft-repeated statement that the Japanese do not assimilate.

At times one feels like laughing outright, and then again like giving vent to auger and disgust. The State Legislature of California presents h confusing sight. Intense activity coupled with fruitless anxiety. A company of men running about like chickens with their heads cut off—no direction or purpose in all this endeavor. A pathetic mania for making bills seems to have seized the majority of the members of that honorable body, each side fearing lest the other should pass a larger number of bills. “Dull Moose,” \"Old Liner,” ‘‘Reactionary,” are epithets (lung in the face of antagonists, with a meaning which only the initiated can fathom. What’s it all about? Nobody seems to know. This is a serious time. Into the maelstrom of ignorance the whole Slate is about In be drawn. The bills before the Legislature —some good and some bad—are being passed without their contents being noted, or their implications or results being carefully studied. In connection with the alien land bills it is a significant fact that neither the authors nor those who are to be called upon to vote on them seem clearly to understand just what is sought. Something is desired, but just what it is is not clear.

To be sure, the father of the author of “Genji” is said to have regretted that such literary talent as he saw developing in his daughter should have been wasted on a girl, and the author of \"Pillow Sketches,” among other drear)’ things the birth of succession of female children in the house of a learned scholar, showing that greater literary development was expected of the boys. Their training was more especially in Chinese literature and philosophy, while that of the girls emphasized the study of Japanese literature and poetry. Still, when the girl’s mind inclined toward the study of subjects considered harder, it would not be that she was denied the privilege of keeping even with her brother. Doth women writers mentioned above were thorough Chinese scholars. One introduced a new kind of prose fiction in Japan centuries before Fielding introduced it into England. The other, “on account of her learning and talents was appointed a lady-in-wait-ing to the Empress.\" Still, from a literary standpoint, Japanese poetry has long heen considered woman’s specialty. Women of literary or religious turn of mind, when left widows, entered nunneries. It was rpiite the custom. The life here was not servile. We read in Aston, page 103, of the grandmother in a nunnery accompanied by a grandchild and two servants. These nunneries were Huddhist institutions. In them learning was fostered as well ns religious spirit. From the seventh century, when the Empress Suiko, by encouraging Huddliisin and adopting Chinese civilization, introduced a long era of culture and refinement, down through all the centuries of feudalism, the women of Japan were prominent in the literary field. In tlie year 005, at the command of the Mikado, a collection wan. made of tlie best Japanese poems up to that date. The collection contained eleven hundred poems, fn a comparatively recent time out of that collection n hundred authors have been chosen, and from their poems the best and most characteristic poem of each has been selected. These hundred poems make the popular Japanese card game. Of the hundred ancient poets represented in this game, twenty-one are women. Hut the greatest and most highly appreciated work of the Japanese women was not in literature. Ft was in character building. Her most far-reaching influence was to be left through her children. The Japanese woman has always bc£n. and still is, pre-eminently domestic. Home has always been the center of her activities. The samurai homo was to ho a quiet retreat for the warrior, a shelter and school for the children, a center of influence to reach out toward the lower classes especially through the servants. Such was the ideal. We will leave the domineering lord, the disrespectful son, and jealous mother-in-law out of this picture. They have appeared in the foreground long enough. There is a skeleton in the closet in every home, they say. Better leave the closet door shut whenever we can. as in every-day life, so in history. YAMATO ICTIIIIASIII. (To be continued.) HOW PEOPLE OF FLORIN FEEL ABOUT JAPANESE The following is a letter of Mr. L. M. Landsbnugli to Assemblyman Shartel, telling him the truth concerning Japanese people in his district.-Editors Florin, Sacramento Co., Cal., March 27, 1913. Hon. A. F. Shartol, Judiciary Committee of Assembly. Dear Sir —I desire to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 26th Inst., and to thank you for your very full and frank reply to my letter on the alien land bills. In inditing my previous communication I purposely made It brief, knowing of the flood of correspondence with which legislators are favored, and the greater chances It had of finding Its way Into the waste basket unless this were done. Taking yours ns permission to do so, I trust you will pardon me If I go more Into detail now In referring to this important question. First of all, I will give you credit for being sincere In your stand. I do glory In a man who has the courage of his convictions. In return, I trust that you will grant that my views are not warped by mercenary or ulterior motives, and that I, too, am actuated by the same feelings as yourself. During the past ten or twelve years I have been among the Japanese In this community In many capacities, have hired them In my vineyard, have rented to them, had charge of a basket factory employing forty or fifty Japanese, hove waited on them over the counter In a general merchandise store and am at present manager of their fruit exchange. When It comes to Japanese farm laborers In this particular locality I think I know them and know what I am talking about. I can say that with rare exceptions, they are honest, Industrious, respectful, and a law-abiding people and generous to a fault. With a population ranging between one and two thousand during the harvest season, on arrest or a disturbance of the peace In the community Is unknown. Now, what is your personal experi -! encc with the Japanesef As to your communication In detail: ' you say that you note with a good deal of Interest my observations concerning the $lOO,OOO worth of strawberries i shipped annually from here. I do not hold that as an argument solely why the Japanese should be perpetuated In this district. It Is, however,' an Incident. You say, “What becomes of this money?\" Concede that It Is sent, out 1 of the country, Is It any benefit to this; country that a large financial business | Is done here, and that the Inhabitants i doing that business send all of the! profits out of the country? It Is such i conclusions as yours that mislead the masses and create race prejudice. Can't you see that In doing a business of this magnitude that the express companies get possibly $15,000 or $20,-! 000, and keep their men employed? The boxmaker gets $lO and gives em-' ployment to his mlllhands. The railroad gets a share of It, and they say they need It moat. To get the land In condition for planting the farmer gets seme of It. To get the water on the i NO. 4784. ;cn can any that the negro linn been any benefit to this country” la certainly rough on the American who holds any jthcr view. My experience with the American negro la bo limited that I am not In a position to combat your statement. However, your opinion, while doubtless conceded to be correct by Ben Tillman, 1h not the broad American view on this subject, and savora somewhat of your generalities and conclusions on the subject under consideration —the Japanese. Asking your pardon for this lengthy affliction, I am, Respectfully yours, L. M. LANDSBAUGH. DR. MABIe’Jn KYOTO.

Only time and closer intercourse are the possible factors which solve the race problemn. Customs and understanding would slowly and (painfully, with the assistance of (time, find solutions of this question No law however cleverly it is made, nor any treaty however cordially it is made, would fail to accomplish anything towards the solution of this race prejudice. The power of time and habit upon the subject of race problem could be easily found in the United States The foundamental race problem in this country is that of the negro. At the time of Civil War, what prejudice was against the Negro, we all know. How the colored race was treated even after tne Civil War, we are aware of. The right and freedom that were given by the law to the Negro after the Civil War, are little or nothing compared to the rights and freedom the Negro enjoy to-day. The recent decision of the United Supreme Court declaring the Civil rights act of 1875, unconstitutional, makes no difference whatever to the Negro. They have earned by the assistance of time, such rights and freedom that they enjoy to-day. The time assisted the white people to mingle with the race and\" know more of the people. And the habit of seeing the Negro among the white people, by and by lessened the prejudice of the white people against the black. This effect of time and contact is true in the racial -question of any country and whatever race is involved in the question. To try to abolish the race hatred by making a new law or by making another treaty with another nation, is an attempt unworthy of any clear sighted statesman. They could ma!# several new laws and make various new treaties about the subject. But those laws and treaties, would do nothing for the solution of the race question. The race question of Japanese in the United States could not be stopped nor solved by a new law. No one man or one government with all its power and strength could aolve this question. The solution of this matter, requires the assistance of time, and by slow and painful effect of habits and contact, the matter would be solved at the end. It is not a kind of problem which could be solved in one day, nor in one year. It is the problem [ which requires yeare of painful experience before it could be solved. , The contact of the Japanese with ; the American public and the slow [ effect of the mutual understanding the Nationalists, who-carried the resolution -against the loan by a vote of 222 a gainst 125 The same resolution was introduced in the Senate and discussed for hours.

Interpellations were showered upon the acting Premier; but he merely repeater that'the loan contract was formerly approved by the previous Senate, and so it is not in violation of tlx Provissonal Constitution.

    "paragraphs": "JULY 27, 1913 THE JAPANESE AMERICAN 340 MASON STREET. SAN FRANCISCO - - • CALIF PNONI, DOUGLAS 111 ENTERED AT DAM FRANCISCO H*ODT OMICI A* SECOND CLASS MATTER. T. KOBAYABHI PROP. A EDITOR THE CANAL AND ITS ENEMIES. By Dr. David Starr Jordan. What answer shall we give to Admiral Mahan’s demand for a greater navy* because the Panama Canal weakens our lino of defense? This tireless sea-dog, in the New York Times, tells us that the Panama Canal, once built and provided with costly fortifications, so far from strengthening our position in the militant world (at the best, precarious), adds still further to our weakness. Of our whole coast “it is through its isolation the most exposed. It is intrinsically the weak link of the chain.” “The fortifications and associated troops arc to insure this hold on the canal while the navy may la* absent on its mission of action in cither ocean, but neither works nor troops will secure ultimate security* if 1 lie navy U* inferior to the enemy’s.” The admiral does not state who the enemy is whose imaginary attacks we arc spending so much good money to repel. He dreams of war, but duly of war against “the enemy.” We may infer, however, that it is Japan who is on the watch for this, our weakest spot. He tells us that the “population of our Pacific States is less than 20 to the square mile, while that id’ Japan is over 300.” He further clinches his purpose with reference to an utterance some years old of that fine old Japanese gentleman, Count Itagaki, who lias spent his last years trying to remove the element of heredity from titles of nobility, and. thus far without success, to get rid of his own title of Count. Only the Emperor can cancel an honor of this sort. Count Itagaki believes that the people of the world arc entitled to access to any part of it. and that the doors of America should not be elosed to Japanese who may* wish to take their part in the building of the West. Perhaps he is right. It is a question of social philosophy*, and this no-hlc-spirited old man has a broad outlook. Hut this is far, very far, from advocating an armed attack by Japanese ships and' soldiers on the Isthmus of Panama, it is infinitely far from ensuring feats of arms or deeds of violence. Some excellent men in the United States have thought that Canada should have accepted our views of reciprocity. To say this is very far from committing armies to invade Canada, putting reciprocity through by force of arms. The purposes of Japan are very simple. She wishes to hold her own at home, to build up her industries, and to pay her debts; and meanwhile to make good her ventures in Korea and Manchuria. Sin* has passed through the terrible calamities of the war with Russia, and her tremendous burden of debt cannot be lifted for | half a century. She would not fight us if she could. Sin* could not if she would—and there is nothing in the world to fight about. It would be easier for us to seize any Japanese port than for her to seize Panama. There will be no seizing done on either i side. When information as to Japan's history, purposes and resources is so readily accessible it is not easy to bo patient with those belated war experts who talk of Japanese invasions, whether in America. I Australia or New Zealand. SOCIAL PROGRESS OF JAPAN DURING TOKUGAWA ERA. The present day achievement o» Japan seems to have overshadowed the glory of the Tokugnwa era. which stretched for a space of 250 years, preceding the new age ushered in with the opening up of hei seaports, about half a century ago. for international commerce. All the necessary preparations had been going on for many centuries. The idea of democracy, for instance. was not imported from abroad at the beginning of the new era. but it is quite indigenous with the people, though it sounds curious to hear it spoken of in the age of Samurais. Under the feudal monarchy of Tokugawa Shoguns local self-government progressed with a stride. It was a policy* of leyasu. the founder of Tokugawa government and the famous Constitution. that the condition of the Agricultural, industrial and eommercial classes should be improved, and their social position In* raised against their superior, the Samurai 霣迅元代理販嫌菜宥犬飼久太郎氏をして霣妗社の肥料代珥販奴入たらしめし以來长に因ヶ年幸に鍺忍の深學なる麵引立にょ > 螽々 ¢ 況 1: 赴き候段挛 'A 謝候软ては *8*:: の御 № 志 I:I8 いんが *&^- III^^^0^. な &1 小 № 蜘 I 罹截卞次第可仕候御瀣考の I 助 ¢1 相戌供はド幸甚 |： 存候沔卒怙 II の ！ 6 引立 1： 預 6 度覼上慊 110 081.5 肥 =1 ー ー ー 籼 1 1 ボ腳腿 % 人造把科各種 ？ 话當速 、 狭酸ァンご ー ャ 、 硫酸加里 、 ： ニ ， 於 、 遇供 ！！： 1， ス孅祀 、 骨粉 、 <1 纷タンゲ ー ジ石灰帘索 ， 其他 %# ( 日本製 ) ¢0 野菜類 、 蠢類 、 花園用肥料 2 してニ十年來の杯驗ご學 9 1： ょト最 18 當 |： || 合致します布哇人造肥料株式會社 THE JAPANESE AMERICAN ENGLISH SECTION. ' class, with view to the effect that these peace-loving commoners serve as a check to unbalanced accumula ttmi of power in the hands of the warrior class, lest his government might fall prey to tyranny. More freedom being granted to the commoners than to the salaried Sam'urais, the development of municipal system and local self-govern-ment organized by the populace, and the guild system in vogm among merchants and artisans gradually encroached upon the political power and prestige of the Samurai. Great land owners and wealthy merchants rose up against the Samurai families who possessed no | virtue but rusty swords and heavv debts. The great commercial city of Osaka stood rival to the Samurai | town of Edo. now Tokio, in mil-1 ferial prosperity*. Popular liters-1 ture of Chikamatsu and Saikaku protested against social conventions with their realistic fervor, the theatre arose against the “no” play which was patronized by tin Samurais alone. Along with flies.-, the progress of popular education known as the Terakoya system and the multiplication of private insti tides for higher learning in com petition with the government schools in Edo and Kioto; the propagation of Vangniinism which i laid emphasis on the culture of individual personality by self-knowl-edge. against Shukism. a minion of the government, which inculcated the traditional morals based on the politico-ethical teaching of Confucius; the rise of Shingaku or popu lar dialectics against the classical canons; the intensive study of Japanese classics and history against Chinese classics resulting in thej Shinto revival and rekindling of a religious zeal for the imperial rub and freedom of the nation from the ; Samurai yoke; the rise of th otokodate. who prided themselves on the worth of mere “manhood” manfully defying, as champions of the people, any t.vrannical deeds of i Samurais—all these facts eon spired together, in thought and i deed, to undermine the feudal ( regime of the Tokugawa Shogun ate. whose founder had believed his dynasty should last forever, and never dreamed of having his pol icy eventually produce such an in jurioiis effect for his distant pro geny. The Tokugawa monarchy gasp <1 its last with the accession of tin last Emperor Meiji in 1 SI»S-. the territorial system then snugly* occupied the place of the feudal one: tin* local self-government and mu nicipal administration as well as the consolidated central government with representative system, elaborately modeled after Euro pean nations, began to operate their political mechanism without | iuilich bloodshed nor with tremendous struggle, which is usually ac eompanied by an epoch-making change in the history of any nation. Such a peaceful appreciation of the new regime enjoyed by the whole nation is chiefly due In the educational and social training they received during the Tokugawa era. The striking progress of modern Japan, however strange it may appear to a casual observer, would have been quite impossible unless she had a steady and inner development of humanitarian interests and the idea of freedom during the preceding epoch. It. H. ASSIMUSABILITY OF THE JAPANESE. | Some time ago the Japanese papers, such as the Oaakn Asa hi and the //<<hi simultaneously deluied the alleged inability of the Japanese to assimilate American institutions The Tnki/o Asa hi. in I following their example, supports its contention by citing ccrtai*. statements made by American offi eials relative to the condition of the Japanese immigrants. Tie alien land law. it says, will ennm into force a month and a half lienee, hut the negotiations he tween Tokyo and Washington have so far made no progress The situation cannot hut make one pessimistic as to the future. What is most regrettable is the recent tendenev \"f American opinion on this affair. The Americana win support the act, on the ground that the Japanese arc not assimiI table, have greatly increased in i number. S.mc. while refrainin': from the assertion that tin* Japanlest* are inferior to the Americans, maintain that the two peoples | differ so greatly from cneh other tin respect to ideas, civil hod ion and history, that they cannot harmon i/e with each other. Others con I tend that tin* admission «»f cheap (Japanese labor is highlv detri | mental to the interests of Amerl can laborers. But Iwilh arguments are superficial in the extreme, being effectively refuted by tie statements of American officials i themselves. The investigations made by tin* Federal and the Cali I fornia authorities agree in shoving that though not equal to tie* French and Hermans. the Japan•.e are superior to tie* Italian Portuguese and Hungarians in p* spect to their mithusiasm in tb* study of Fiiglish and the assimilation of American institution As for the cheapness of Jnpaiies* labor, the American Immigration Committee points out that fie* wages earned by the Japanese have rapidly ri-en in recent years, while the rise of the white manV ■ wages has I wen slow, so that the difference is no longer worthy of! notice. What could the anti-Jap-, aneae puhlicistH say in face ofj< those statements by their fellow countrymen T Hut grant and thiis a very important concession that their assertions contain 1 grain of truth. Kven so. thi 1 could he an excuse only for ol»-|. jeeting to the increase of Japanese] settlers in America, not for perse - cuting Japanese who have gone through the proper legal process in entering the I'nited States, and I have been living there for years The Japanese now engaged in ng ricultural pursuits in America have entered, and dwell in. 1 lint I country by virtue of the most favored nation clause, and are legally i entitled to equal treatment with I the other immigrants. Their a! leged inability to assimilate American institutions is no excuse for official discrimination against | them. ARBITRATION WITH AMERICA. The arbitration treaty with the I'nited States of America is to ex pire in August next, and it has be**n agreed upon by both partied to prolong its operation for fiv** veara more The agreement habeen signed at Washington by Mr Bryan, Secretary of Stn» and Ambassador Viscount Chlnda The text of the treaty is as fob lows: “Article 1.

Mr. Takataro Kimura Affirm. That the Yamnlo Once Ruled the World. Ho mils this lore by giving ft new j r* ailing and Interpretation tn the con- L Iti nts of the ancient national lltera- ( 1 Mire, the Kojiki. and other depositories , i t»f the mythology, the manners, the language and the traditional history , of ancient Japan, by the light of the;, advanced knowledge of the day and ( j of comparative philology. In detail, he proceeds with this task; In this way: ill To make char the L place «f the Japanese In the systems L of mythologies; (2l to find the exact L group of languages to which Japanese ; belongs, by Interpreting the vocabular le.s of the ancient hooks by various other languages; (3) to Institute a elos* Investigation Into the geography of ancient history; and (4» to ascertain the relations of the ancient his tory of Japan with the histories of the ancient nations of Europe and dls rover references to undent Japan. In the ancient histories of other Oriental countries and of the Occident. If the methods employed by Mr Kimura in his Japanologtcal Investigations he new and revolutionary, at ! least In the field he explores, the procress of his explorations are startling in their interest. But Interesting us they are wo have little space for even ian outline of his dissertations. When : his translation comes out we may have ■an opportunity to give a fuller Idea I of his discoveries. j If we can believe nil the wonderful , translation and Interpretation of the words and geographical terms that Mr , Kimura marshals in proof of his ■ henry of the (iraeco-Lat In-Egypt lar. origin of the Japanese, we must say: i Long Indeed are the annals of tin ; Vamato race, and Just indeed Is Its claim to he the Subrrn Empire! If you permit Mr. Kimura to Infusi you with the fervor of his conviction and ■ • nrhusiasm. you would easily he led to conceive Japan, and not Russia, as the best arbiter of the situation ;in the Balkans, and to believe that th - (Japanese were • barged with a heaveni appointed mission to cry shame upon ! Californians for their spirit of Inimical exclusion on the authority of the ;gospe| of universal pa. Miration tnuchr 1 alike by Its own founder and the j author of Christianity whom the author considers one and the same. Kojiki a Venerable Record. That the Kojiki Is the earliest authentic connected literary product of that large division of the human race whl h has been variously denominated Turanian, Scythian and Altaic, and even precedes by ai least a century the most ancient extant literary com- NO. 4903, positions of non-Aryan India, is admitted by Chamberlain. It was certainly not for want of hints that the older scholars did not look to Occidental sources for the elucidation of j this antique story. It Is quite probable also that nil the known racial traditions said to have I wen deposited In 1 the wonderful memory of lllyedano 1 Are and recited hy him to Yasumaro I should give In a condensed outline the ! great events that took place prior to land since the coming of that race to I these islands. Nor can we take exception to the method employed by ) Mr. Kimura. Only the long flight he I takes at once to the Mediterranean j regions Is. as the author boastfully exj peels bewildering to minds that would And It (aster to see the course of the ships that brought our ancestors to these shores traced back by a more gradual process. Particularly strong I Is this feeling when the author maps out all too definite Itineraries of the migration only on the ground that the personal ond geographical names are translatable or explainable by lan- | images still believed to belong to j mother system. In other words, he j pays, as he himself avows, no attention to the philological details of the countries he runs over in the long but rapid flight. This gives a sense of violence done to scientific accuracy. So that, while we may appreciate the boldness and broadness of his conceptions, we may accept his conclusions as [ highly valuable ns far ns they go. hut necessarily hypothetical until many a , gap In the system Is bridged room completely by the author’s own future studies nr by those who follow him on the road he has opened. (The End.) JAPANESE ARE ASSIMILABLE. Sir Valentine Chlrol, formerly foreign editor of the London Time*, in a letter to the Journal, replies to Rear Admiral Mahan. He denies that the Japanese Immigrants are not assimilable. and quotes American authorities to show that no race tends more to harmonize with American civilization than the Japanese. He asserts that the danger la this that the absolute denial by the I'nPed States of the remedy afforded by naturalisation may precipitate an Issue, which, however. If wisely conducted, need not become serious. Further, he repeats that the color j ban can not logically be pleaded as prohibitive by a country that admits a large negro community to equal rights in citizenship. TOKYO TAISHO EXPOSITION. We have received the Rules and Regulations of the Tokyo Talsho Exposition. to he held in commemoration of the accession of His Majesty the Emperor. The exposition will occupy a site In I’yeno Park, will h • opened on March 20 and closed on July 31, 1014.

A SURVEY OF 1 HE JAPANESE QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA By J. Sovkda mid T. Kamiva. CHAPTER 11. ('oulnilions Itroiifflil Forward. There are many reasons raised for the exclusion of the Japanese, hut the chief ones may he summarized under the following four headings: 1 Political. 2—Economical. J—Social. 4—Racial. FIRST: The Political Contentions. (a) The Democratic party coming into power, changes came in the way of dealing with the subject, because it bad been laying great stress on individual state rights. The progressives in California turned a deaf ear to the words of the President, and Mr. Bryan’s personal persuasion was of little avail except that the wording of the Alien Land Bill was made more diplomatic and the clause allowing three years lease was inserted at the request of the agricultural community of California. The bill being signed by the (lovenior, it fell to the United States government to decide, and it was placed in a very difficult position. Again it seems to have placed Hie final settlement on the shoulders of the court. Jt is much to be regretted that a question of such international importance should be made a subject of p. rty polities. and not be settled lie fore it became so serious. fb) Labor unions in San Francisco were ever active in working against the Japanese, and so as not to lose their favor, politicians in California bad to support the bill, with the exception of a few, such as the Senator from San Diego, who stood for justice and fought so bravely to the end. If the Japanese had had the power of voting things might have been different, so that their helpless situation is much to be pitied. (c) Some believe that democracy must be a homogeneous body, so that the foreign element such as the Japanese—must be excluded. But if we turn our eyes to the already existing heterogeneous condition of the American population, composed of negroes. Latins, Slavs. Jews, and what not. the argument falls to the ground. America is strong enough to assimilate different races; and the essential feature of a democracy being equality, it is against its nature to be exclusive or partial. Hi l If is much to be regretted that fears, quite unfounded, have been entertained especially sine* the late war in contrast to tiesympathy shown Japan before and during her life and death struggle. To say that Japan is a warlike nation is absurd. What other nation enjoyed peace for so long a time ns she? If she was forced to go into war, it was solely for her self-preservation and for the Far Eastern peace. If she bad not stood up or bad not been .successful in tin* )nt«* war, what would have been her own fate, as well as that of China? The history of tin* world would have been quite different. It is often said that the Japanese are too patriotic and loyal, but it is not a mere blind patriotism, being founded on the obedience to authority, law and 11nstate. If the Japanese won; admitted to lake part in the American iKidy politic they would make the best of citizens. It has been officially shown that the Japanese in California are the most law-abiding of all immigrants. Yet all sorts of criticisms are piled up on them and groundless fears are aroused because of the selfish purposes of mischief makers and of those who reap benefits, .-ither directly or indii Ily. through the creation of sensations and preparations for war. (a) As the population of the United Slates is now of considerable size, and as there are undesirable elements coming in from all quarters THE JAPANESE AMERICAN ENGLISH SECTION. of the world, the lime lies come for her to place restriction on immigra- ( tion. This contention has much weight when we consider that people I of extreme socialistic ideas and anarchistic inclinations might, some day 1 be a cause of danger to fie* republic. But the restriction should b«* 1 placed equally and fairly on nil, without any discrimination of race or * nationality. It is the unfair discrimination that is most resented by the Japanese nation. ( fb) Natural resources must be preserved for- posterity. Therefore, to let the Japanese buy up all the best land would be a disaster. It. is j true that resources must not be wasted, but the Japanese buying a few. thousands out. «»f hundreds of millions of acres and increasing the t resources of the country, should not be discouraged, especially by such I a big country as America, having such an extent of land lying idle. 1 (e) Some arguments, based on Hie superiority of the Japanese as to (heir hard work, their special skill in raising fruit and vegetables, 1 their extra exertion in case of urgency, etc., s*-m to give rise to the' fear that those who compete with them must surely fail. But this is, an exaggeration of facts, for the lines along which the Japanese arc making their success arc quite different from those in which the Ameri-, 1 cans are working. They arc not competing but doing something for the mutual benefit of both nationalities. fd) Then comes the fear of absenteeism being encouraged if the 1 1 land is entrusted to Japanese hands. tli<- landlords all going eastward 1 to New York or Europe to enjoy their lime. This, also, is an exaggera- \\ lion of actual facts, for even if the Japanes be excluded, so long as i t here are other people who would lease the land the same thing would' ‘ occur, if it ever does occur. I '■ Attacks, such as the Japanese bring satisfied with lower wages '••r Hu* hind deteriorating if Japanes. come info a district, arc quite \\ contrary to the actual state of things. Japanese get the same wages i as Americans, if not. higher. They an* paying higher rent and an-' going in steadily for improvements on tin- land, and thus have in-' -creased the price of the land in many localities. Another statement | that tin* Japanese use their own goods and send their money back i ‘home, is refuted by Hie very fact that they buy the land and make i I so main investments in America Hranling that they send back a 1 r part of their savings, flu* amount is insignificant compared with that' ; sent home by immigrants of many European countries. In any case, j the best fruit* of the labor of immigrants remain permanent assets] 'of America: what little they send back to Europe or Japan is. in «» broad economic sense, an insignificant part thereof. ■‘•linn- |m i iil«- on I; ;frn-r the art of : photography lins reached Japan, Hh* above method of indirect innr- .

In accordance with the decision i of the last general conference of tlie International Sunday School i I‘onvention held in Switzerland. • the next conference will be called •in Tokyo. In this context the , authorities concerned state that . hitherto such international conventions have been held only in the countries of the first-class powers. It is an honor to this empire, therefore. that the next International Sunday School Convention is to Vie 1 1 ■1 d in lie- rapil.d of 11. ■ count i\\ . • The date for the convention is not yet fixed, but it will probably be held in May. IDlfi. On this occasion not only all the Sunday School children of the empire, but the representatives of the different foreign Sunday Schools will lie in attendance. to the number of more than ten thousand. A regrettable fact i in this connection is that Tokyo is devoid of a public hall large •enough to receive such a great gath- • ering. On such an occasion as a general conference of the Women’s Patriotic Association, tents have so far been utilized. This may !*<• all right so far as any assembly of a domestic nature is concerned, but no such provisional arrangement would answer the purpose of an international convention. The anthor- - dies as well as the publicists of Tokyo are said, accordingly, to be contemplating the construction of a gram! public hall by the time the convent ion is to he called. THE EMPEROR’S BIRTHDAY. • The Official Gazette announces that ‘ August 31st the Kinperor’s birthday will ho observed as a national holiday, hut the formal celebration will be postponed till October 31st. which has been selected as the official day for the celebration of the imperial birthday. The banquet on the Bnipcror’fi birthday will be given on October 31st ami . the birthday congratulations will also la* received on that day. Foreign Visitors to Japan.
